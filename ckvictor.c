/*  C K V I C T O R . C  --  Victor 9000 platform glue for C-Kermit  */

/*
  Serial-only C-Kermit for the Victor 9000 (Sirius 1) under Victor MS-DOS.

  This module supplies the small number of symbols that the portable
  C-Kermit modules reference but that neither the Open Watcom DOS runtime
  nor the modules we chose to leave out of the link can provide.  It is
  deliberately the ONLY Victor-specific C file: everything else in the
  build is unmodified upstream code.

  There are three kinds of thing here:

    1. Unix process-model calls that MS-DOS does not have (fork, exec,
       wait, uid/gid, job control).  C-Kermit only calls these on paths
       that the feature flags in ckvictor.h have already disabled, so
       these stubs exist to satisfy the linker and to fail loudly and
       safely if a path is ever reached that we did not anticipate.

    2. Symbols owned by modules we excluded from the link
       (ckucon.c/ckucns.c CONNECT, ckudia.c dialer, ckcnet.c networking).

    3. Console helpers that ckucmd.c now routes through coninc()/conchk()
       on this platform.  These are REAL and must be implemented against
       the Victor console; see the TODO block at the bottom.

  Every stub is wrapped in "#ifndef VICTOR_HAVE_<name>".  If a future
  runtime provides one, define that macro (e.g. -dVICTOR_HAVE_ALARM) and
  the duplicate here disappears.  The five that Open Watcom's own DOS
  runtime supplies -- exec, sleep, creat, utime, umask, plus a stat() that
  answers "." -- are not written out at all; see section 1a.

  has to reach the real ones, so the renames are undone here -- before any

  Two polls, one for each kind of device, and then the one ioctl this port
  implements -- the reason victor/sys/ioctl.h exists.  in_chk() in ckutio.c
  calls ioctl(fd,FIONREAD,&n) and is the whole of conchk() and ttchk(); see
  that header for why the alternative was a SIGQUIT handler that cannot
  work on MS-DOS.

  Console: INT 21h AH=0Bh returns AL=0xFF if a character is waiting at
  standard input and AL=0x00 if not.

  Anything else: INT 21h AX=4406h (IOCTL, get input status) with the handle
  in BX, which answers the same question for any character device.  This is
  what makes the read in section 0d block, and it is the honest answer for
  the communications device in place of the flat 0 that stood here before.

  Both answer "whether", not "how many", so through those two the answer is
  at most 1.  That is what a poll of either device can honestly say, and it
  is enough for conchk(), whose callers test it against zero.  It was NOT
  enough for ttchk()'s other caller: sdata() in ckcfns.c only slides its
  window when ttchk() exceeds 4+bctu, so a 0/1 answer meant this port
  filled a window before reading ACKs.

  On the communications device neither is used any more.  Once section 1e
  has taken the uPD7201 over, FIONREAD is the depth of its receive ring --
  a real number, which is what SS12 and the milestone were waiting for --
  and TIOCMGET is RR0.  The two calls below remain the answer for every
  other device, and for the communications device before the driver is
  installed or if it never is.

  TIOCMGET matters more than it looks.  in_chk() -- which IS ttchk() --
  asks ttgmdm() for carrier BEFORE it asks how many bytes are waiting, so
  while ttgmdm() returned -3 the whole of FIONREAD was correct and
  unreachable for fd == ttyfd.  See victor/sys/ioctl.h.

  One character from the keyboard, raw and unechoed, and it is the fix for
  the command prompt echoing every line twice.

  read(0,...) goes to the Watcom runtime, which for a character device in
  text mode issues INT 21h AH=3Fh -- and AH=3Fh on CON is DOS's COOKED line
  input.  DOS collects and echoes a whole line, echoes a bare CR when Enter
  is pressed, and only then hands the first byte back.  C-Kermit's parser
  then reads the rest out of DOS's buffer one byte at a time and echoes each
  one itself, from column 0, on top of what DOS already drew:

      C-Kermit>show communications      <- DOS echoed this as it was typed
      show communicationsnications      <- and this is Kermit echoing it
                                           again after DOS's bare CR

  Two echoers and one carriage return.  It looked like a missing newline
  and was not one; PORTING.md SS16ac has the arithmetic.

  AH=07h is "direct console input without echo" and does no Ctrl-C check.
  AH=08h checks, and is deliberately not used: a Ctrl-C taken by DOS goes
  through INT 23h and can terminate the program with the IRQ1 vector still
  pointing into our handler.  Delivering byte 3 to the parser instead is
  both what raw mode means and the safer of the two while SS15's Ctrl-Break
  question is open.

  Extended keys are the untested part.  On an IBM-compatible, AH=07h
  returns 0 and the scan code follows on the next call; whether the
  Victor's keyboard driver does the same is not known, and nothing in this
  build reads arrow keys (NORECALL, NOSETKEY), so the byte is passed

  ckutio.c's myfillbuf() says what it needs, in its own comment:

      "The new myread()/mygetbuf() always gets something.  If it doesn't,
       then make it do so!"

  On Unix that is what a raw tty read does (VMIN=1, VTIME=0).  On MS-DOS a
  handle read of a character device with nothing pending returns 0 at once;
  myfillbuf() turns that into -3, mygetbuf() reports a dead line, and
  ttinl() closes the connection.  Measured symptom before this section
  existed: exactly one Send-Init packet on the wire and then "No files were
  transferred" (PORTING.md SS16a).

  ckutio.c is stock upstream, so the blocking has to happen underneath it.
  ckvictor.h renames read() to v9k_read() for every module in the build,
  and this is that function.  Everything that is not the communications
  device goes straight through to the library's read(), so Watcom's console
  handling and its text-mode translation are left exactly as they were --
  which is the reason for renaming rather than defining read() over the top
  of the library's.
*/

/*
  alarm() was a stub that returned 0 and never fired, on the reasoning that
  this port's timeouts come from C-Kermit's own protocol timer.  That is
  not true of the timeout that matters here.  ttinl() -- the packet reader
  -- arms alarm(timo) around a setjmp and expects SIGALRM to longjmp out of
  the read; that longjmp IS its timeout return of -1.  With alarm() dead
  there are only two ways out of a read that never completes, and ttinl()
  treats neither as a timeout: it closes the connection on a -3 whose errno
  is not EINTR, and it retries forever on one whose errno is EINTR.  So no
  packet would ever be retransmitted, and a link that dropped mid-transfer
  would hang instead of recovering.

  MS-DOS has no interval timer this port is allowed to use -- hooking INT
  1Ch is not INT 21h (hard rule 6) -- but it does not need one.  The only
  place this program can block is the poll below, so the alarm only has to
  be looked at there: record a deadline in alarm(), test it in the poll,
  and when it has passed, call the SIGALRM handler synchronously.  timerh()
  longjmps and ttinl() returns -1, exactly as on Unix.

  Resolution is whole seconds because time() is what both runtimes agree
  on, and because alarm()'s own argument is in seconds.  That resolution
  costs a second in the wrong direction, and an earlier version of this
  comment had the direction backwards.  time() is a floor: arm alarm(n)
  at real time T+0.9 and time() reports T, so a deadline of T+n is
  reached at real T+n -- only n-0.9 seconds later.  A deadline of time()+n
  therefore fires in (n-1, n], which is *early*, by up to a full second.

  That is not the noise the old comment assumed it was.  CK_TIMERS is on
  and rttflg defaults to 1, so rcvtimo comes from getrtt(), which is
  itself computed from gtimer()'s whole seconds; on the file-receiver
  path it lands on 3.  A 2-second worst case against the 4.2 seconds of
  line time a 3,999-byte packet takes at 9600 is a timeout that fires
  while the packet is still arriving.

  So the deadline is rounded up by one second, which turns (n-1, n] into
  (n, n+1] -- late, never early, which is the direction a protocol
  timeout wants to err in.  The fudge is added to the deadline and taken
  back off the returned time-remaining, so that the value ttoc() and
  ttinc() subtract from and re-arm with stays the number of seconds the
  caller actually asked for.

/*
  PORTING.md SS16k and SS16l measured the same thing four times without being
  able to name it: rxpeak reads 500 to 547 across two ring sizes, two
  fixtures and longest-packets from 2,668 to 3,905 bytes.  At 9600 that is
  about half a second in which the handler below kept storing bytes and
  nobody took any out.  rxpeak says how big the pause is; it does not say
  what the foreground was doing, and every candidate -- the inter-packet
  file write, the console, the drain loop itself -- predicts the same
  high-water mark.

  So the handler latches one thing more.  The foreground keeps a single byte
  saying where it is, at the four places in this file that can hold it up,
  and the handler copies that byte at the moment it raises rxpeak.  Cost in
  the interrupt path: two stores, taken only when the high-water mark moves.
  No INT 21h anywhere near it, which is the whole point -- SS16k's lesson is
  that an instrument slow enough to starve the receive changes the number it
  was asked to report, and the debug log at 25ms a byte is exactly that.

  What each value means when it comes back out at exit:

    0  Upstream code.  Not inside anything below, so the time went on
       decoding, on stdio's own buffering, or somewhere else we do not own.
    1  The library's write(), for a descriptor that is not the comm device
       -- zoutdump()'s file write, V9K_OBUFSIZE bytes at a time (it was
       ckcker.h's OBUFSIZE, 1024, when this was written; SS1d below now sets
       the size and ckvictor.h says why).  The standing candidate, and
       v9k_wtagfd carries the descriptor so the console can be told from
       the file.
    2  v9k_ser_put(), the polled transmitter: an ACK on its way out.  Its
       spin is bounded at 60000 turns, which the comment there calls "a few
       tenths of a second" -- the same time scale as the stall, so it is a
       candidate and not just bookkeeping.
    3  The library's read(), again for something that is not the comm
       device.
    4  v9k_comm_read() itself.  This is the important one to be able to
       rule out: if the peak is latched here, Kermit was reading the whole
       time and simply could not keep up, which is a rate deficit rather
       than a stall -- the opposite of what SS16k concluded from rxpeak
       alone.

  WIDENED FOR SS16r, which asked for it by name.  The vocabulary above has
  five values and four of them are ours, so everything else -- most of the
  program -- came back as 0, "upstream".  SS16r's first loss was tagged 0 and
  that named no suspect at all: packet decoding, stdio and the DOS file open
  that follows the F packet are one bucket.  Three cheap widenings, none of
  them on a per-byte path:

    5  fopen().  The receive file is CREATED here -- a directory search and
       a FAT allocation inside one INT 21h -- and it happens between the F
       packet and the first data packet, which is exactly the stretch
       SS16r's first burst landed in.  Renamed in ckvictor.h the same way
       read() and write() are.  ckufio.c's zopeno() calls the bare open()
       just before this to ask whether the name is a tty; that one is a
       lookup that fails with ENOENT on a new file, so the cost is here.
    6  v9k_ser_get(), the copy out of the ring, as distinct from the loop
       around it.  4 used to cover both, and they are not the same thing:
       the loop is where the foreground WAITS with interrupts enabled and
       is holding nothing off, while the copy is real work with the ring's
       tail moving under the handler.  4 keeps its old meaning (somewhere
       in v9k_comm_read()) so SS16r's peaktag=4 stays readable; 6 is the
       part of it that could actually matter.
    7  fclose().  The 8K flush and the directory update at the end of a
       receive, for the same reason as 5.

  And the breadcrumb, which is the one that widens 0.  These four regions
  used to store V9K_TAG_NONE on the way out; they now store V9K_TAG_UPBASE
  plus the tag they are leaving, so "upstream" subdivides into "upstream,
  since the file write returned" (9), "since the ACK went out" (10) and so
  on for the same single store.  A loss tagged 12 is upstream after a ring
  drain -- packet decoding.  A loss tagged 9 is upstream after a file write
  -- between packets.  Those are different places in the protocol and 0
  could not tell them apart.  0 now means only "before any of these ran".

  nap()'s counters, declared here with the other timers because the exit
  report is above the function -- nap() itself is in section 1d, and so is
  the argument for why this port has one at all.

  They exist because the defect they replace was SILENT.  msleep() returned
  0 and the program carried on; only a logic analyzer aimed at something
  else found that a 500ms hold-off was 175us (PORTING.md SS16an).  A
  counter is what makes the repair visible without one:

    per  spins per centisecond, from the calibration.  Zero means nap()

    n    calls that actually delayed.
    req  milliseconds asked for, summed.
    tot  centiseconds the clock says elapsed, summed.

  Read tot against req with the quantum in mind, exactly as SS16n says for
  wfile: ONE 500ms nap reads 50 or 100 and neither is wrong.  What the pair
  rules out is the defect -- 175us reads 0 nearly every time.  Because
  exithangup is 1 by default (ckcmai.c:1290), ttclos() calls tthang(),
  which calls msleep(500), so EVERY run that opens the line exercises this

  the transmitter is done, one when the read comes back round.

  The OTHER side of the ACK, and PORTING.md SS1 item 9 is what asks for it.

  v9k_gap_* above measures ACK-sent to next-read and reads 0.00 s over 18
  packets (SS16af leg AG), which says the foreground goes straight back to
  reading once the ACK is away.  So none of the non-line cost is after the
  ACK; all of it is BEFORE -- between the last byte of a packet being handed
  up and the ACK for that packet going down.  That interval is decode(), the
  file write and the protocol state machine, and it is the 15.895 s that
  SS16aq could only get at by subtracting line time from the wall clock.

  With a window of one it is free: the host sent one packet and is silent
  until its ACK comes back, so nothing arrives while we are in here.  That
  is exactly what stops being true at DFWSIZ > 1 -- the host is sending the
  NEXT packet through this whole interval, and the receive ring has to hold
  every byte of it, because nothing drains the ring while the foreground is
  decoding.  So this counter is the ring requirement for a window, measured
  BEFORE the window is opened:

      bytes the ring must absorb = (dec tot / dec n) x (bytes per second)

  which at 38400 is centiseconds x 38.46.  The same number is the payoff:
  it is the time a window overlaps with the line instead of adding to it.

  dec tot MINUS wfile tot is the decode alone, which is why the two print
  next to each other.

  Cost is one INT 21h per read return and one per serial write, of the order
  of five per packet against the ~883 ms per packet being measured.  The
  0.5 s clock quantum (SS16n) means a single packet reads 0 or 50 cs and
  nothing in between, so quote tot=, never max=; SS16ap put that noise at
  +/-1.5 s on one leg, which is why this wants four legs or none.

  Like wire=, it is a RECEIVE-leg figure.  On a send leg the serial writes
  are data packets and the reads are ACKs, so it measures ACK-in to
  next-packet-out -- a real quantity, but not this one.

  READ tot= WITH THIS CAVEAT OR NOT AT ALL: an interval that contains a
  SILENCE is not a decode, and this counter cannot tell the two apart.
  SS16ar leg WA came back max=3250 cs -- 32.5 SECONDS -- and nothing decodes
  for 32 seconds.  The interval spanned a stall: the far end stopped
  sending mid-packet, and "last byte in to next byte out" swallowed the
  whole wait.

  The obvious guard was built and it DOES NOT FIRE.  v9k_comm_read()'s
  alarm path spoils the open interval and counts it in to=, which is right
  for a timeout of OURS -- and to= read 0 on all four legs of SS16ar,
  because SS16l already established that every timeout in these logs is the
  HOST'S.  Our alarm never expires; we sit in the read loop while the far
  end works out that it needs to retransmit.  So the guard is correct, it
  is kept for the case it covers, and it is not the case that happens.

  What that leaves: on a leg with 0 timeouts, tot is the whole story.  On a
  leg with timeouts, the contamination is one enormous interval per stall
  and max= names it, so subtracting max by hand recovers a usable mean --
  SS16ar did exactly that and got 64.6 and 73.2 cs against the 68.2 that
  rxpeak/line-rate gives independently.  That agreement is the reason the
  counter is kept rather than removed.

  AND FOR THE RING QUESTION, PREFER rxpeak.  This counter was added to
  predict how many bytes a window would pile into the ring, and rxpeak with
  the window actually open measures the same thing IN BYTES, counted
  exactly, with no 0.5 s quantum and no silence to confuse it.  SS16ai's
  rule: when the clock cannot resolve an effect, find the counter that
  measures the same mechanism in units that do not vary.  dec is the
  cross-check; rxpeak is the answer.

  The wait itself.  Two ways to do it, and which one runs is the whole
  difference between PORTING.md SS16b and a working transfer.

  Once section 1e owns the uPD7201, this drains 1e's receive ring, which
  the interrupt handler has been filling all along -- so the bytes are
  already in memory before Kermit ever asks for them, and "block until
  something arrives" is just "spin until the ring is not empty".

  Before that, and for any line the driver did not take, it polls DOS for
  input status and reads only once DOS says there is something to read; a
  read issued blind is what returns 0 and starts the whole failure off.
  That is the path SS16b measured, and it delivers the first two bytes of
  every inbound packet and then nothing, twelve times out of twelve.  It is
  kept because it is the honest fallback for a device that is not ours, and
  because it is what runs if the install ever fails.

  A read that comes back with 0 anyway is not treated as EOF: the poll
  either raced or the device does not implement the status subfunction (see
  dos_dev_input_ready), and in both cases the right answer is to keep
  waiting.  A serial line has no EOF to report, so the only honest ways out
  of this loop are bytes, a hard error, or the alarm.

          returns with CF CLEAR and AX short -- zero, once there is no room
          at all.  That is not an error by DOS's definition and Watcom's
          write() passes it straight through, so zoutdump() (ckufio.c:2172)
          sees

          take the SUCCESS branch with x = 0, subtract nothing, advance
          nothing, and go round again.  For ever.  The loop has no other
          exit and nothing above it has a timeout: section 0d's alarm()
          bounds the READ, and a receiver that never asks to read is a
          receiver no alarm can reach.  So the far end retries, gives up
          and reports a failure, and the Victor sits there until it is
          switched off -- which is exactly what an out-of-space image did
          to a bench sitting, eleven packets in, on a binary that had
          transferred cleanly twice before.

          On POSIX a regular-file write() cannot return 0 for a positive
          count, which is why upstream has never had to defend against it
          and why this is a report rather than an edit (NEXT_SESSION.md
          SS1 item 8).  Here it is one compare in the place that already
          wraps every write in the program: turn "wrote nothing, no error"
          into the error DOS declined to raise, and zoutdump() takes its
          else branch, returns -1, and the transfer fails the way a
          transfer is supposed to fail.

          A SHORT write is left alone deliberately.  zoutdump() handles a
          partial write correctly and will come round for the rest, and
          the next call is the one that returns 0 -- so the last chunk
          that fits still lands on the disk and only the byte that cannot
          be written is reported.  Counted, because "the disk filled" is a
          fact a leg should be able to state rather than infer.

  CONNECT -- terminal mode, PORTING.md item 18, Tier 1 (pass-through).

  Written fresh as SS13 asked: a small polling loop over the platform
  primitives, NOT ported from ckucon.c (needs fork()) or ckucns.c (needs
  select() on a tty).  Neither of those is reachable here; this file is,
  and this is the "future Victor CONNECT" the old stub's comment named.

  WHY A PASS-THROUGH IS A WHOLE TIER.  The Victor console IS a DEC VT52
  with Heath Z19 extensions (section 1g, PORTING.md SS16ao), so a host or
  BBS set to VT52 or dumb TTY needs no emulation code at all: host bytes go
  straight to the screen and keystrokes go straight to the line.  ANSI ->
  VT52 translation (BBS "ANSI") is Tier 2 and lives beside the display code
  in section 1g when it is written; autodownload (CK_AUTODL) is the other
  Tier-1 item and is off in this build today.  This is the base both rest on.

  THE LOOP IS TWO POLLS AND NO BLOCK.  ttchk() is a real ring depth since
  section 1e took the uPD7201 over (installed by tcsetattr() at SET LINE /
  SET SPEED, so the ring is already live when CONNECT starts), and
  conchk() is INT 21h AH=0Bh.  On a single 8088 with nothing else to do,
  a tight poll is the lowest-latency arrangement and costs only cycles that
  would otherwise be spent in a nap; there is no second thread to yield to.

  HOST -> SCREEN IS BATCHED, KEYBOARD -> HOST IS NOT, and that asymmetry is
  the console-write cost (v9k/probes/vconw.c, item 18): a drained run is
  written to the screen in ONE conxo() call rather than one conoc() per
  byte, because the INT 21h console write is dominated by per-call overhead.
  Keystrokes arrive one at a time from a human, so there is nothing to batch
  on that side.

  Both builds link this.  In CKERMITW (384K, -c one-shot) escaping ends the
  loop and mainline then exits, dropping DTR through tthang() (exithangup);
  in CKICP (the parser build) escaping returns to the C-Kermit> prompt.  The
  difference is entirely in ckcmai.c's stayflg test -- this function just
  ends the loop with cx_status set and lets mainline decide, which is why
  one implementation serves two binaries.

  Terminal naming.  There is exactly one console, and the important half of
  that sentence is that the serial line is NOT it.

  This returned "CON:" for every descriptor, and it cost SET LINE.  ttopen()
  decides local versus remote by opening the device and then asking
  ttyname() what it really is (ckutio.c:3180), comparing that against
  cttnam -- which sysinit() filled in from ttyname(0), i.e. "CON:".  So
  opening /dev/seriala got fd 7, was told it was called "CON:", concluded
  the line was the controlling terminal, set xlocal = 0 and then forced
  ttyfd to 0 as well (the NOFDZERO block at ckutio.c:2919).  SET SPEED then
  said "?SET SPEED has no effect without prior SET LINE" because it was, by
  then, quite right.  PORTING.md SS16aa.

  Only the interactive path reached it: that whole test is inside
  "if (*lcl < 0)", and cmdlin()'s -l passes lcl = 1, so the shipping build
  told ttopen() the answer instead of asking.  Which is why file transfer
  has worked for the port's whole life with this stub in it.

  POSIX says ttyname() returns NULL for a descriptor that is not a terminal,
  and returning NULL is what ckutio.c wants: it treats an empty answer as
  "not the console" and leaves xlocal at 1.  Descriptors 0-2 are the
  console; 3 and 4 are DOS's STDAUX and STDPRN, and everything the port

  See victor/sys/termios.h for the design, and PORTING.md SS11a for how
  this reaches the hardware.

  Two halves.  The SOFTWARE half is the cached struct termios, the B*
  speed codes and the bookkeeping ckutio.c drives; it is what lets the
  console share this code, where there is nothing to program.  The
  HARDWARE half applies the cached settings to the uPD7201 and the 8253
  by handing the OEM serial driver a 17-byte control block through DOS
  IOCTL -- speed, character width, stop bits, parity, DTR and RTS.

  It does that with the descriptor ttopen() already left in ttyfd.  There
  is no second open, no interrupt vector and no memory-mapped access: the
  whole of this section is INT 21h, which is why it could be built and
  tested before the driver in SS11b exists.

  This is MS-DOS Kermit 3.13's model, not an invention.  msxv90.asm drives
  this same chip on this same machine and uses its SERIALA handle for
  exactly three things -- open, close, and this IOCTL.  It never reads or
  writes data through it.  PORTING.md SS16b measured what happens when you
  do: the first two bytes of every inbound packet arrive and the rest
  never does.  So the OEM driver is a configuration channel here, and the
  data path is SS11b's problem.

  Nothing below moves a byte.

  ckutio.c keeps several struct termios of its own (ttold, ttraw, ttcur,
  ...) and treats tcgetattr as "read back what I set".  Caching one
  current setting here matches that and costs 32 bytes.

  That last paragraph was true of the whole section until section 1e
  existed.  It still is of everything except the four calls below that now
  reach it: tcsetattr() ends by installing the driver, and tcflush(),
  tcdrain() and the release path are 1e's.  Nothing here moves a byte; 1e
  does.

  The driver's control block.  AH=44h, AL=02h to read it and AL=03h to

  msxv90.asm's "pval" structure, which cites Systems Programmers Toolkit
  II, Appendix A; that appendix has since been read directly and agrees
  field for field.  The nine CR bytes are the uPD7201's write registers;
  on channel A, CR2A is its WR2 and CR2B is channel B's, which the OEM
  documentation names the interrupt vector.

  The four 16-bit fields come first and the nine bytes after, so the
  struct has no interior padding; the trailing pad to an even size is why
  the length below is a literal 17 rather than sizeof.

  Appendix A says to pass CX = 9, which is the count of CR bytes and not
  the size of anything it describes -- its own field list adds up to the
  17 below.  17 is what msxv90.asm passes and what PORTING.md SS11a
  measured working on Victor MS-DOS 3.1.  Do not "correct" it to 9.

  Note also that AL=02h does NOT read the chip.  Appendix A: "when a
  request is made to set the port, the configuration information is
  saved.  Then if the current configuration is requested the parameter
  block last used to set the port is returned to you."  So a read returns
  the driver's cache of its own last write.  That is still exactly what
  the read-modify-write in tcsetattr wants -- the driver applies the whole
  block, so preserving the fields we do not set preserves what it will
  apply -- but nothing that comes back from here is evidence about the
  state of the uPD7201.  Section 1e reads the chip when that is the
  question.

  B* code -> 8253 divisor.  Indexed by the ordinals in sys/termios.h, so
  the order of the two lists has to stay in step.

  These are msxv90.asm's "bddat" values, which vickermit.c reproduces
  byte for byte; the rule behind them is 78125/baud.  See sys/termios.h
  for why the numerator is 78125 and not the 76800 an earlier revision
  assumed.

  B200 was the one entry neither of those two tables had, and it used to
  be round(78125/200) = 391.  Systems Programmers Toolkit II, Appendix A
  prints the OEM driver's own table and it says 390 (0186h), so that is
  what is here now: matching what shipped beats matching the arithmetic,
  and 78125/390 is 200.3 bps either way.

  Appendix A also prints 1.8k as 26h = 38, and that one is NOT taken.
  78125/38 is 2056 bps -- faster than the same table's 2.0k entry (27h =
  39, 2003 bps) while labelled slower -- where 2Bh = 43 gives 1817.  A
  transcription error, and 43 is what stays.  Appendix A's table stops at
  19.2k.

  B38400 (divisor 2) is msxv90.asm's: its bddat table ends "dw 2H ; 38400
  baud" and its keyword table ends "mkeyw '38400',15".  B76800 (divisor 1)
  is NOT -- an earlier version of this comment said both were, and the
  string 76800 does not occur anywhere in msxv90.asm.  Divisor 1 has no
  source at all: not Appendix A, not 3.13, not the 1980s vickermit.c.  It
  was extrapolated by continuing the halving, and as an x16 setting it is
  unprogrammable: the 8253 is in Mode 3 (msxv90.asm's control byte is 36H,
  and v9k_ser_progline() below writes the same) and modes 2 and 3 both
  require a count of at least 2.

  B76800 is therefore gone from victor/sys/termios.h, and so are B57600 and
  B115200, which existed for one day as x1 entries.  x1 does reach those

  claim in this file -- but it fails on a free-running link.  PORTING.md
  SS11a0.  39,062.50 bps at count 2 is the ceiling OF THE INTERNAL CLOCK
  TREE.

  CORRECTED 2026-08-22 (operator): an earlier revision here claimed the
  LS90/8253 chain is the only path to RxCA and "there is no external clock
  that would make it work".  Wrong, and the operator had said so before: the
  serial connector's RxC/TxC clock pins reach the 7201 through the same
  LS153 at 15F, selected by VIA2 PA0/PA1 (the schematic's _INT/EXTA and
  _INT/EXTB; the boot ROM's "6522 FOR CLOCK SELECTION" writes them to INT at
  reset).  An external clock bypasses the 8253, keeps x16 oversampling, and
  is the route past 39,062 bps on this hardware.  This port does not program
  the EXT position, so ITS table still ends at B38400 -- a statement about
  this driver, not about the machine.

  The divisors themselves are now measured rather than argued -- CLK5 is
  5 MHz on a logic analyzer and reaches the 8253 through two LS90 halves,
  so the counters see 1.25 MHz; see victor/sys/termios.h and PORTING.md
  SS11a.

  B0 is not a speed -- POSIX gives it the meaning "hang up" -- so its
  entry is never used; tcsetattr drops DTR and RTS and leaves the divisor
  alone, which is how msxv90.asm's SERHNG implements HANGUP.

  THE CLOCK MODE IS x16, AND ON THE INTERNAL CLOCK THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE TO
  GO.  For one day this file carried a v9k_clkbits[] table so that
  B57600/B76800/B115200 could use the 7201's x1 mode and reach rates the
  8253 cannot produce with a legal Mode 3 count.  The bench killed it: x1
  works, and a 32 KB send at x1 completed byte-exact, but x1 RECEIVE
  accepted 33% of 110-byte packets where x16 was clean at a three times
  worse rate mismatch.  PORTING.md SS11a0.

  A previous revision then claimed the schematic "closed the last avenue" --
  that no external clock reaches RxCA at all.  That was wrong (see the
  CORRECTED note above the divisor table): the connector's clock pins reach
  the 7201 through the LS153 under VIA2's _INT/EXTA and _INT/EXTB selects,
  and an external x16 clock is a real route past 39,062 bps.  What is true
  is narrower: this driver runs on the internal clock, and there x16 with
  count 2 -- 39,062.50 bps -- is the top.  The table above ends where the
  INTERNAL clock tree does, not where the machine does.

  The overrides survive because the experiment should stay repeatable
  without a broken rate in the table:

      make -f victorow.mak XFLAGS="-dV9K_CLKBITS=0x00 -dV9K_COUNT=130"

  0x00 is x1, 0x40 x16, 0x80 x32, 0xc0 x64.  They override every speed, so
  such a build ignores -b and SET SPEED entirely -- deliberately: one build,
  one point, no ambiguity about what was on the wire.
*/


/*
  The last divisor we actually programmed.  The hang-up path changes the
  modem lines and must NOT change the speed, so it has to put back a
  divisor rather than leave the field at whatever is in the block.

  The read does round-trip "baudr" correctly -- PORTING.md SS11a measured 8
  coming back -- but only when the request is well formed, and a
  malformed one returns carry-clear and an untouched block.  A silent
  failure that leaves a stale value in a field we then write into the 8253
  is not worth the risk when the value is this cheap to remember.

  The console needs a cache of its own, and giving it one is a bug fix
  rather than tidiness.

  ckutio.c drives BOTH devices through this same pair of calls.  congm()
  seeds ccold/cccbrk/ccraw with tcgetattr(0,...) (ckutio.c:12375-12377),
  and concb(), conbin() and conres() write them back with tcsetattr(0,...)
  (ckutio.c:12566 and neighbours).  While there was one cached struct,
  every one of those console writes landed on top of the communication
  line's settings -- including c_ospeed, which is what ttgspd() reads.
  SET SPEED would program the chip correctly and then have its recorded
  speed overwritten by the next console mode change, so SHOW
  COMMUNICATIONS reported whatever the console struct happened to carry.

  It was nearly invisible under NOICP, where the console changes state
  perhaps twice in a run and nothing reads the speed back afterwards.  The
  interactive parser calls concb() at the top of every command
  (ckuus5.c:2779) and again from popclvl() at the end of every take-file
  (ckuus5.c:5107), which is where it was found.

  Nothing here programs anything: the console has no uPD7201 behind it, so
  the console half of tcsetattr() is a store and a return.  The two structs
  start identical, which is exactly what congm() used to be handed.

/* 1e. The uPD7201 data path -- our interrupt, our ring, our transmit   */
/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

/*
  Section 1b configures the line through the OEM serial driver.  This
  section moves the bytes, and it does not use the OEM driver at all: it
  talks to the uPD7201 at its memory-mapped address, hooks the interrupt
  the 8259 raises for it, and keeps a receive ring of its own.  Together
  they are PORTING.md SS11's two halves, and the split is MS-DOS Kermit
  3.13's -- msxv90.asm opens SERIALA, uses the handle for IOCTL and for
  nothing else, and puts the data path here.

  The reason it has to be here is measured, not theoretical.  SS16b and
  SS16a put a byte-correct Send-Init packet on the wire through the OEM
  driver's write() and then read the reply through its read(): twelve
  reads, every one returning exactly two bytes, three separate runs, on a
  line whose registers SS11a had just programmed and read back to confirm.
  The OEM driver transmits and cannot receive.  3.13's authors reached the
  same conclusion with the same hardware in 1986.

  What is here:

    - an interrupt handler on IVT slot 41h that empties the receiver into
      a 512-byte ring, and resets the chip's error latch when it has to;
    - a polled transmitter, because transmit was never the broken half and
      because a receive-only interrupt is the smaller thing to get right;
    - the real answers to FIONREAD (the depth of the ring) and TIOCMGET
      (RR0), which is what makes ttchk() mean something for the first time;
    - install and release, and the direct-to-the-chip fallback for a DOS
      whose serial driver does not implement the SS11a IOCTL.

  Two things it deliberately does not have.

  There is NO STACK SWITCH.  A C interrupt handler runs on whatever stack
  it interrupted, and the compiler will not give us one (PORTING.md SS11b);
  a dedicated stack would have to come out of the same 64K DGROUP that
  already holds the main stack.  3.13's SERINT does not switch
  either, on this machine, and it shipped.  The handler below holds no
  arrays, calls nothing, and its frame is reported by -fstack-usage next to
  every other function in the build -- which is the number to watch if this
  ever turns out to be the wrong call.

  There is NO INTERRUPT-LEVEL FLOW CONTROL.  3.13 sends XOFF from inside
  SERINT at a 3/4-full water mark.  With one channel, a window of 1 and a
  512-byte ring there is at most one packet in flight, so the ring cannot
  be driven full by a correct peer; it would start to matter with streaming
  or a real window, and the counters below are there to say so if it does.

  Constants -- the segments, the vector, the 8259 masks and EOI, the
  register values and the order they have to be written in -- are read out
  of msxv90.asm rather than guessed.  ~/projects/myfreedos's
  kernel/victor_int14.asm and victor_pic.asm agree independently on the
  addresses and on the RR0 bit assignments.
*/

/*
  Memory-mapped, not I/O ports: IN and OUT do not reach any of this.

  On the 7201 the "control" address is both the status port to read and the
  command port to write.  Reading it gives RR0; writing a register number
  to it points the read/write pointer at that register, and the pointer
  resets itself to 0 after the next access -- which is the property that
  lets the handler below and the foreground share the port without a lock,
  as long as neither ever leaves the pointer parked.

  IR1 on the 8259 is "all from the 7201", and under the Victor's own ROM
  configuration it arrives as INT 41h -- msxv90.asm carries the vector as
  mdintv = 104h, which is 4 x 41h, with the 8259 mask bit and the specific
  end-of-interrupt byte that go with it.

  This is the one constant here that is not a property of the hardware.  It
  is a property of how the 8259 was programmed at boot, and the three
  answers in circulation on this machine are all different:

      Victor boot ROM       ICW2 = 0x20    IRQ1 -> INT 21h+0 ... 27h
      Victor MS-DOS 3.1     ICW2 = 0x40    IRQ1 -> INT 41h
      FreeDOS for Victor    ICW2 = 0x08    IRQ1 -> INT 09h

  The first two are msxv90.asm's mdintv = 104h = 4 x 41h and the Victor
  Boot ROM v3.6 listing; the third is ~/projects/myfreedos's
  kernel/victor_pic.asm, whose own header comment gives all three and
  whose IRQ_BASE is 0x08 because it remaps the PIC to the IBM layout so
  that FreeDOS's stock handlers work.

  SO A BUILD THAT HARD-CODES 41h IS NOT THE ONE BINARY THIS PORT CLAIMS
  TO BE.  On FreeDOS it would take the vector DOS uses for something else
  entirely, leave the real IRQ1 vector pointing at FreeDOS's own serial
  handler, and receive nothing -- while looking, from the C side, exactly
  like a chip that never interrupts.

  ONLY THE VECTOR MOVES.  The mask bit and the specific EOI below encode
  the IR LEVEL, not the vector, so ICW2 does not touch them; and
  ckvisr.asm, which issues the EOI, needs no knowledge of any of this.

  HOW IT IS DECIDED, and it is INT 21h so hard rule 6 holds.  The 8259's
  ICW2 is write-only -- there is no way to ask the chip what base it was
  given -- so the question has to be put to whoever programmed it.  INT
  21h AH=30h returns the OEM number in BH, and FreeDOS answers 0xFD --
  myfreedos/hdr/version.h:40 defines OEM_ID as 0xfd and says in so many
  words that it is what int 21 30 returns in BH, and kernel.asm:75
  carries the same byte in the version block.  Anything else is treated
  as the MS-DOS 3.1 layout, which is the conservative way round: 0x41 is
  what every leg in this project has run.

  XFLAGS=-dV9K_IRQ1_FORCE=0x09 overrides the probe without a source
  change, which is the control leg for the day someone tests this on a
  FreeDOS that answers something unexpected.  The exit report prints
  "v9k: dos oem= ver= irq1=" so a leg says which branch it took rather
  than leaving it to be inferred.

  ckvisr.asm reaches every one of these through DS, having loaded it from

  lengths -- so the question "is the peak sitting on the retransmission?"
  becomes arithmetic rather than argument.

  And the same treatment for the loss itself, which is what PORTING.md SS16p
  ended by asking for.  SS16p measured rxlost at 0, 0, 203 and 207 across the
  four rates and could not say what shape the loss had, because rxlost is a
  running total and a total cannot tell 203 separate misses from four bursts
  of fifty.  Those are different defects: 203 misses is a handler that is too
  slow per byte, four bursts is something that holds the machine off four
  times and has nothing to do with per-byte cost.

  Read rxlost carefully first, because it is not what SS16p called it.  Each
  entry to the handler can raise it at most ONCE -- it is set from a single
  test of the latched RR1 bit -- so it counts INTERRUPTS THAT FOUND AN
  OVERRUN, not bytes.  A hold-off long enough to lose fifty bytes presents
  the handler with one latched bit and the three the receiver managed to
  keep, so it can raise rxlost by as little as one.  rxlost is therefore a
  LOWER bound on bytes lost, and SS16p's "0.45% of received bytes" is a lower
  bound too.  What is unambiguous is that each increment means at least one
  byte went missing.

  So the four below bracket the shape rather than the size:

    lostevt   bursts.  A loss opens a new one when more than V9K_LOSTGAP
              bytes have been received cleanly since the previous loss, and
              continues the current one otherwise.  If this comes back 4
              against rxlost 203, the loss is four bursts and the foreground
              is being held off; if it comes back near 203, the handler is
              losing single bytes all through the transfer and the cause is
              per-byte cost after all.
    lostmax   the longest of those runs, which sizes the worst hold-off.
    lostat    byte offset at the FIRST loss, with losttag/lostfd -- section
              0e's tag, latched at the loss the way peaktag is latched at
              the peak.  This is the one that names a suspect: the peak is
              a consequence of the hold-off and the first loss is inside it.
    lostend   byte offset at the last loss.  With lostat it says whether the
              losses cluster in one stretch of the transfer or run through
              it, which the host's packet log then converts into packets.

  Separating the bursts by a gap in the STREAM rather than by "consecutive
  entries to the handler" is deliberate, and it is what keeps this free.
  Consecutive-entry counting needs the good-byte path to clear the run,
  which Watcom codes as a DGROUP reload and a store -- about 5us of a 260us
  byte at 38400, on the one path that runs per byte, in an instrument whose
  entire purpose is to find out whether the per-byte path is too slow.  That
  is SS16k's mistake exactly.  Measuring the gap instead puts every added
  instruction on a path that by measurement runs 203 times in 42,757 bytes,
  and it is the better definition anyway: one good byte drained in the
  middle of a hold-off should not read as two hold-offs.

  V9K_LOSTGAP is 16 because the two scales are nowhere near each other.
  Losses inside one hold-off land within a few stream positions of each
  other -- the receiver is three deep -- while distinct hold-offs are
  separated by whole packets, which are thousands of bytes here.  Any
  threshold between about 8 and 1000 gives the same answer.

  And the table SS16r asked for, which is the whole point of this revision.
  SS16r came back evt=5 max=179 and could not say how many BYTES the 179
  covered -- 179 losses no more than V9K_LOSTGAP apart span anywhere from
  about 180 to about 3,000, and that range is the difference between one
  blocking hold-off of ~46ms and a rate deficit running the length of a
  long packet.  Those are different defects with different fixes.
  lostat/lostend bracket the FIRST and LAST loss of the whole run, which
  spans all five bursts and answers nothing.

  So: first offset, last offset, count and tag, per burst, for the first
  V9K_LOSTBURST of them.  A burst's span is bend - bat and is read directly.
  SS16r's other two asks fall out of the same table rather than needing
  code: the largest burst is whichever row has the largest n, so there is
  no need to choose between tagging the first burst and tagging the largest
  -- every row carries its own tag.

  Two tags per row, not one, because they answer different questions.
  btag is where the foreground was at the burst's FIRST loss, which is the
  suspect: whatever was running when the receiver first fell behind.
  bendtag is where it was at the last, and the pair says whether the
  foreground moved during the burst.  A burst that opens and closes in the
  same place is one long operation; one that starts in a file write and
  ends somewhere upstream is a hold-off whose effects outlived it.

  All of it is on the rare path -- inside "if (rr1 & V9K_RR1_OVERRUN)",
  which by measurement runs 322 times in 43,589 bytes and not at all in a
  clean run -- so the per-byte cost this instrument exists to measure is
  untouched.  That is SS16q's rule and it is why the burst boundary is
  still a gap in the stream rather than a run counter cleared per byte.

  8 rows is 8 * (4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1) = 112 bytes of .bss, which comes
  out of DGROUP (hard rule 4) and is reported by "make -f victorow.mak
  sizes".  It is sized off SS16r's five bursts with room to see that the
  count grew; lostevt still counts them all, so an overflow is visible
  rather than silent.

  SS16t's counters, and the branch they sit in is the point.

  ANSWERED, AND THE ANSWER IS NO.  Kept because a dead hypothesis with a
  counter still attached to it is cheaper to leave than to re-derive, and
  because the counter is what makes every future run say so again for free.

  SS16s measured 1.03 bytes lost per overrun interrupt, twice, at 38400 --
  a steady HALF-RATE deficit rather than a stall, sustained for tens of
  milliseconds and starting hundreds of bytes into a packet rather than at
  its front.  Nothing in the foreground explained it: the tag said
  upstream, the ring never filled, and a disk 100x slower changed nothing
  (SS16s leg S).  What halves a service rate without involving the
  foreground at all is a second interrupt source sharing the line, and the
  uPD7201's other channel is exactly that -- see the comment on
  v9k_off_oth for why this handler could not clear it.

  SS16t ran it at the bench at 19200 and 38400: norx = 0 and othrx = 0 in
  BOTH.  Every interrupt this program has ever seen was a real received
  byte on our own channel.  There is no storm, nothing else shares IRQ1,
  and the deficit is the handler's own cost -- which is where SS16t went
  next, after correcting the byte time it had been reasoning from (260us
  at 38400, not the 26us four comments in this file used to claim).

  What each counter says, if it ever comes back non-zero:

    isrnorx   entries where OUR channel had no received byte.  Measured 0
              twice; anything of the order of the byte count would mean
              the handler is being entered twice per byte by something
              else.  This is the whole experiment.
    isrothrx  of those, how many found a byte waiting in the OTHER
              channel's receiver -- which is the difference between "some
              other device shares IRQ1" and "it is the half of this chip we
              did not take".
    norxrr0   our RR0 and the other channel's, latched at the first such
              entry, so a cause that is not RXRDY at all (a break, a
              transmit-buffer-empty, an external/status change) is still
              identifiable from the bits.

  Every one of these is inside "if (!(rr0 & V9K_RR0_RXRDY))", a branch that
  already exists and that a healthy run never takes.  The per-byte path is
  not touched, which is SS16q's rule and SS16k's mistake.

  Reading the other channel's RR0 costs a pointer reset (writing 0 to WR0
  is a null command that only sets the register pointer) and a read, both
  on that same rare path.  It is a diagnostic build's licence: the other
  channel belongs to the OEM driver and we are reaching into it.

/*
  THE TABLE, AND WHY IT HAS A SWITCH -- which is a mistake of SS16s, found
  in SS16t, and worth stating plainly because the rule it broke is one this
  file has been careful about twice before.

  SS16q's rule is "keep the instrument off the per-byte path".  SS16s
  checked that, in wdis, and the clean path came back 67 instructions
  before and after -- so the table looked free.  That was the wrong path to
  check.  The overrun branch is rare only while the receiver is keeping up.
  Once it falls behind, every byte for the rest of the packet arrives with
  the latch already set and takes this branch: INSIDE A BURST, THE OVERRUN
  PATH IS THE PER-BYTE PATH.

  The numbers say it is not free there.  Same fixture, same rate, same
  bench, and the only thing that changed between the first row and the rest
  is this table:

      SS16r, before the table     rxlost = 322,  max = 179
      SS16s leg Q                 rxlost = 810,  max = 473
      SS16s leg R                 rxlost = 849,  max = 473
      SS16t leg V                 rxlost = 784,  max = 467

  2.5x, and the mechanism is positive feedback.  A byte arrives every 260us
  at 38400; the handler is marginal against that; one overrun puts it on
  this longer branch; the longer branch guarantees the next overrun; and
  the burst sustains itself until the line goes idle at the end of the
  packet.  That last clause is testable and already tested -- it is why
  every burst measured so far ends on a packet boundary.

  So: XFLAGS=-dV9K_LEANLOST builds the overrun path in exactly SS16r's
  shape -- Error Reset, rxlost, the burst detector, the BELL, nothing else
  -- which makes this an A/B on one variable instead of an argument.  Near
  322 confirms the feedback model and says the defect is handler cost.
  Near 800 says the table was never the difference and something else
  changed between SS16r and SS16s.

  The counters the table replaced (lostevt/max/tag/at/end) stay in both
  builds, so a lean run is still readable next to a full one.

/* 1f. Flow control -- RTS/CTS and XON/XOFF, both directions            */
/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

/*
  PORTING.md SS1 item 11.  Two mechanisms, two directions, and the four
  combinations are genuinely different pieces of code, so they are named
  apart rather than folded into one "flow" variable:

    v9k_fc_in    how WE hold the FAR END off, when our ring fills.
                 XOFF: transmit one, once.  RTS: drop the WR5 bit.
    v9k_fc_out   how the FAR END holds US off, before we transmit.
                 XOFF: obey one seen in the input stream.  CTS: test RR0.

  Both come off the termios struct in tcsetattr(), which is upstream's own
  plumbing rather than a private flag: ttpkt() sets IXON|IXOFF in c_iflag
  for FLO_XONX and tthflow() sets CRTSCTS in c_cflag for the hardware
  settings.  IXON is POSIX's "obey the far end's XON/XOFF on our output"
  and IXOFF is "send XON/XOFF to control our input", so the two termios
  bits map onto the two directions exactly.  (tthflow() only does anything
  because ckvictor.h defines POSIX_CRTSCTS; without it that function
  preprocesses to an empty body on this platform, which is why CRTSCTS had
  never once reached this file.  The comment on that #define has the
  measurement.)

  WHERE THE ASSERT LIVES, AND WHY IT IS THE HANDLER.  The whole point of
  flow control here is the case where the FOREGROUND is not running -- it is
  inside a 0.5-second file write, or decoding a packet -- so a hold-off the
  foreground has to raise cannot be raised when it is needed.  The interrupt
  handler is the only thing that runs during a stall, and it already
  computes the ring occupancy the water mark is a test on.  So the ASSERT is
  in the handler (both of them, ckvisr.asm and v9k_ser_isr) and the RELEASE
  is in v9k_ser_get(), which is by definition running.

  WHAT IT COSTS THE HANDLER, because SS16t is the reason that question gets
  asked.  On the clean per-byte path, two things:

    * one word compare of the occupancy against v9k_rxhigh.  This is why
      the mark is a VARIABLE and not V9K_RXHIGH directly: with flow control
      off it is set to 0FFFFh, and occupancy is masked to 4,095, so the
      compare can never be true and no second test is needed to know that
      flow control is off.  Two instructions, always.
    * one byte test of v9k_fc_out before the byte is stored, to decide
      whether an XOFF in the stream is data or a command.  Two instructions,
      always; the three that follow only when XON/XOFF is selected.

  Call it 25 clocks on a 5 MHz 8088, ~5us of the 260us a byte takes at
  38400, ~2% of the handler.  That is affordable now in a way it was not
  before SS16af -- rxpeak is 2,581 of 4,096 with the ring no longer the
  binding constraint -- but it is a real cost and it is paid by every build,
  including the ones with flow control off.  It is measurable the same way
  everything else here is: a 32 KB receive at 9600 under MAME reproduces to
  1 ms (SS16ag), which is far finer than the effect.

  WHAT IS *NOT* IN THE HANDLER.  3.13's SERINT polls TX-ready in a loop
  bounded at 65,536 turns before writing its XOFF (msxv90.asm:srint9), after
  an sti.  Neither half of that is copied.  Polling with interrupts off
  blocks receive, which is precisely the defect SS16t fixed and SS16v shows
  there is no headroom to reintroduce; and re-enabling interrupts inside a
  handler with no stack switch invites a nested entry on a 10-byte frame.
  So the XOFF is SINGLE-SHOT: test RR0 for a free transmit buffer once, and
  if it is busy do nothing and try again on the next received byte.  The
  cost of a missed attempt is 260us at 38400 and the ring has 1,024 bytes of
  headroom above the mark, so ~4 byte-times of slippage against ~3,900 of
  margin.  RTS/CTS needs none of this, which is the other half of why it is
  the cheaper mechanism.

  THE ONE RACE, and it is why v9k_ser_put() disables interrupts.  Both the
  handler and the polled transmitter write the SAME data register.  The
  transmitter's sequence is "test RR0 for TxEmpty, then store" and an
  interrupt taken between the two would let the handler put an XOFF in the
  buffer that our byte then overwrites -- one character lost from the middle
  of a packet, which the block check would catch and the protocol would
  retransmit, so the symptom would be a slow line and not a wrong file.
  Bracketing the test and the store with cli/sti closes it for two
  instructions per transmitted byte, against 260us of wire time each.

  RELEASE.  v9k_ser_get() drops the mark to v9k_rxlow before it lets go, so
  the far end is not restarted into a ring that is still nearly full.  1/4
  and 3/4 are 3.13's MNTRGL/MNTRGH on this same chip.

  WHAT THIS UNBLOCKS, which is the reason it is worth having at all while
  nothing needs it.  Two things turn on it, and the second is the surprise:

    * WINDOWING.  DFWSIZ is 1, and that is what holds rxfull at 0 -- the far
      end sends a packet and waits for our ACK, so bytes in flight never
      exceed one packet.  Open the window and that stops being true.
    * LONGER PACKETS.  The worst case at a window of one is a foreground
      that drains nothing for a whole packet, so occupancy equals the packet
      length.  The longest this port has put on a wire is 3,991 and the ring
      is 4,096.  THAT 105-BYTE MARGIN IS AN ACCIDENT -- DRPSIZ = 4000
      happens to sit under V9K_RXBUFSIZ -- so DRPSIZ could not be raised past
      about 4,090 either.  Now it can, because there is something to fall
      back on when the assumption breaks.

  Neither is done here.  Raising DRPSIZ or DFWSIZ still needs a run that
  reaches FINISH and reports rxlost/rxfull/rxpeak, and now also one that
  reports the counters below.

  How long any foreground spin on the transmitter waits before giving up.
  60,000 turns is a few tenths of a second on a 5 MHz 8088 -- hundreds of
  character times, and still short enough that a dead line cannot hang the
  program.  Used by v9k_ser_put() below, which is where it was defined
  until section 1f wanted it too.

  V9K_FCSPIN is the OTHER bound, and the two are separate on purpose: the
  one above is for a broken chip and this one is for a working peer that is
  holding us off.  A far end whose disk write takes a second is entitled to
  keep XOFF asserted for a second, so spending the transmitter's budget on
  it would turn ordinary flow control into a write error.  600,000 turns is
  of the order of seconds rather than an exact figure -- it is a backstop
  against an XOFF whose XON never arrives, not a timeout anyone should be
  relying on.  When it fires, v9k_fc_stuck counts it and the write comes
  back short, which is what ttol() already knows how to retry.

  THAT BACKSTOP IS NOT BELT AND BRACES, AND THIS IS WHY.  POSIX's recovery
  from a lost XON is tcflow(TCOON), and ckutio.c does call it -- ttoc()
  reaches for it when a single-character write has timed out and flow is
  XON/XOFF (ckutio.c:10849).  But it is written as

      debug(F100,"ttoc tcflow","",tcflow(ttyfd,TCOON));

  and under NODEBUG ckcdeb.h:5486 defines debug(a,b,c,d) as NOTHING, so the
  call is discarded with the macro.  Measured, not read: "tcflow" does not
  occur anywhere in the preprocessed ckutio.c for this build except in its
  own prototype.  It is the only caller of tcflow() in the Unix module, so
  in any NODEBUG build -- which is this port's default -- the entire POSIX
  unstick path is gone.  A functional side effect inside a debug argument
  is an upstream defect and belongs in PORTING.md SS8's report list, but it
  is not this port's to fix quietly (hard rule 1), and it means the driver
  cannot delegate its own recovery to it.  Hence the bound here.

  Watcom's __interrupt __far pushes a fixed register set plus DS, loads
  DGROUP rather than trusting the interrupted DS, and ends in iret.  It
  emits no stack probe here.

  The body is 3.13's SERINT with the terminal-emulator half taken out:

    1. Read RR0 and RR1 before anything is acknowledged.
    2. Tell the 7201 the interrupt is over, then the 8259 -- 3.13 does both
       early so the machine is not held off while we work.
    3. Nothing waiting: return.
    4. OVERRUN.  This is the step PORTING.md SS16b says is not optional.  The
       chip LATCHES an overrun in RR1 and will not resume receiving until
       WR0 gets an Error Reset, so a handler that skips it wedges the
       channel on the first byte it was late for -- which is the exact shape
       of what the OEM driver does to us today.  msxv90.asm's edit history
       records this being found and fixed twice on this hardware in 1986.
       3.13 also stores a BELL in place of whatever was lost, and that is
       copied: the packet is ruined either way and will be retransmitted,
       but the length stays right, so ttinl() still finds the next SOH
       where it expects it rather than one byte early.
    5. Store, and drop the byte if Kermit has not kept up.  Dropping the
       NEWEST byte rather than overwriting the oldest is deliberate -- the
       oldest bytes are the front of a packet Kermit is about to read.

      the other thing a .OUT file cannot tell you and it is worth more than

      byte and that a run worth measuring cannot carry a debug log; that
      warning has been in this file since SS16k and three REMOTE DIRECTORY
      legs ran with -d anyway (SS16i, and SS16av legs NR/NT/NU), because a
      comment lives in the source and the trap lives in the run sheet.
      nxtdir() in ckcfns.c debugs FOUR TIMES PER OUTPUT CHARACTER, so on
      that path -d is ~100ms a character: SS16aw ran one binary over one
      listing with the flag and without it and got 33.787s against 2.248s,
      15x, and the slow arm had been read for two sessions as the feature
      being broken.  One integer, printed by the run itself, is what makes

      reason is the first version of this field: doexit() (ckuusx.c:5478)
      zeroes deblog and closes ZDFILE before calling exit(), so reading the
      variable from an atexit() handler reported deb=0 on a leg that had
      just spent 33 seconds writing a debug log.  The live value is ORed

  Ctrl-C while the line is open, and what was wrong with it.

  The old note here said this was "known, not measured on either runtime".
  Both halves are readable, and reading them turns a vague caution into a
  two-keystroke defect with a three-line fix.

  OPEN WATCOM'S HALF (bld/clib/process/c/signl.c, sigsy.c).  signal() hooks
  INT 23h lazily: any signal(SIGINT, f) with f other than SIG_DFL calls
  __grab_int23(), and signal(SIGINT, SIG_DFL) hands the vector back to DOS.
  The installed handler calls raise(SIGINT).  And raise() is the old
  unreliable-signal kind:

      case SIGINT:
        if (func != SIG_IGN && func != SIG_DFL && func != SIG_ERR) {
            _RWD_sigtab[sig] = SIG_DFL;         <-- demoted
            __restore_int23();                  <-- vector given back
            (*func)(sig);
        }

  So a handler fires ONCE.  After that SIGINT is SIG_DFL, INT 23h belongs
  to DOS again, and DOS's own INT 23h terminates the program on the spot:
  no atexit(), no v9k_ser_release(), IRQ1 still vectored into memory that
  is about to be handed to the next program.

  UPSTREAM'S HALF (ckutio.c:1705-1718, 2727).  ttopen() installs cctrap,
  whose entire body is "cc_int = 1".  And cc_int IS READ NOWHERE IN THE
  TREE -- one definition, one assignment, no readers.  So the first Ctrl-C
  of a session did nothing observable AND spent the runtime's single shot,
  and the SECOND one killed the program with the chip still hooked.  That
  is the whole of the exposure and it needed two keystrokes, which is
  probably why it was never seen: legs are driven from .BAT files.

  THE FIX is to be the handler and to re-arm inside it, which is what the
  demotion above obliges every handler on this runtime to do.  Installed
  from v9k_ser_install() rather than from an initializer, because
  ttopen()'s signal() runs later and would overwrite an earlier one; the
  cctrap it displaces cannot be missed, having no readers.

  exit() from here is legitimate rather than merely convenient: DOS calls
  INT 23h at a re-entrant point and documents that the handler may
  terminate the process, and Watcom's own handler has already re-enabled
  interrupts before raising.  exit() runs atexit(), which is
  v9k_ser_release() -- transmitter drained, IRQ1 restored, mask restored.

  What this deliberately does NOT do is try to make Ctrl-C cancel a
  transfer and continue.  That would need a flag upstream reads, and the
  only such flag in this build is the dead one above.

      Section 1f, and the placement is the whole of the reasoning -- it is
      SS16ai's lesson applied to a second variable.

      What this port wants to say is "the default flow control for a direct
      serial line is X", and the durable place to say it is NOT the variable
      upstream reads.  main() runs initflow() at ckcmai.c:3269, which sets
      cxflow[] from its own table and then flow = cxflow[cxtype]; anything
      an XI initializer put in either would be gone before ttopen() was
      reached.  What runs AFTER initflow and BEFORE the value is used is
      this install, because it is called from tcsetattr() and tcsetattr() is
      called from ttopen() -- and every ttopen() in this program is followed
      within a few lines by cxtype = CXT_DIRECT and setflow(), which is the
      call that copies cxflow[cxtype] into flow (ckuusy.c:3941-3943 for the
      -l option, ckuusr.c:11245 and neighbours for SET LINE).

      So writing cxflow[CXT_DIRECT] here lands one statement before the copy
      that reads it.  Writing "flow" instead would be overwritten by that
      same copy -- which is exactly the shape of the prefixing defect SS16ai
      found, where an initializer set the variable and initproto() copied
      over it 118 lines later.

      It also gets the parser build's precedence right for free.  SET FLOW
      sets autoflow = 0 (ckuus3.c:11939) and setflow() returns immediately
      when autoflow is clear, so a typed setting is not disturbed by this
      one.  Which flow control is v9k_flowsel, from ckvictor.h's V9K_FLOW
      and the command line; see the initializer in section 1d.

  And the selection.  WHAT IT READS IS UPSTREAM'S "flow" VARIABLE, and the
  reason it is not the termios bits is measured rather than argued -- the
  first version of this function read the bits, and leg FB of PORTING.md
  SS16aj came back with the mode still off.

  ckutio.c's ttpkt() DOES set them.  Its SVORPOSIX arm puts IXON|IXOFF in
  ttraw.c_iflag for FLO_XONX (ckutio.c:6617) and calls tthflow(), which
  puts CRTSCTS in ttraw.c_cflag for the hardware settings.  Then, 141 lines
  later and 4 lines before the tcsetattr() that applies the whole struct,

      #define TESTING234
      #ifdef TESTING234
          if (1) {
              ...
              ttraw.c_iflag &= ~(INPCK|IGNPAR|IXON|IXOFF);      ckutio.c:6758

  clears them again, unconditionally, on every BSD44ORPOSIX build.  It is a
  debugging block that was left switched on -- "if (1)" inside an #ifdef of
  its own #define -- and it means SET FLOW XON/XOFF cannot reach a driver
  through termios on any modern Unix build of C-Kermit 11, not just this
  one.  It does NOT touch c_cflag, so the CRTSCTS half survives; the port
  reads that back as a cross-check below and logs both.

  So there are two candidate sources, one of which is right for one
  mechanism and wrong for the other, and taking the one that is right for
  both is not a workaround -- "flow" is upstream's own answer to "what flow
  control is in effect", it is exactly what ttpkt() was passed, and reading
  it at the moment ttpkt() programs the line asks the question at the right
  time.  NEXT_SESSION.md's design note said to implement against the
  termios bits and not a private flag; this is not a private flag, and the
  note was written on the premise that the bits arrive.

  Mapping.  FLO_XONX is the only soft setting this driver implements.
  FLO_RTSC is the only hard one: FLO_DTRC and FLO_DTRT drive DTR, which on
  this machine is a WR5 bit with no water-mark meaning, so they are treated
  as none rather than half-implemented.  FLO_KEEP and FLO_AUTO never reach
  a driver -- setflow() resolves AUTO and ttpkt() resolves KEEP.

  Every call re-asserts RTS in WR5 (tcsetattr computes cr5 with the bit set
  and writes it), so any hold-off in force has just been cancelled by the
  hardware whatever this file believes.  Clearing v9k_holding is therefore
  not a reset for tidiness, it is keeping the flag equal to the pin.

  closes the device and returns -2.  A three-wire cable between two Victors,
  or between a Victor and anything else, does not carry DCD, so a literal
  RR0 would end every transfer at the first ttchk().  But C-Kermit has
  already told us whether it wants carrier to mean anything: ttopen() and
  ttpkt() call carrctl(), whose entire body is "set CLOCAL when carrier is
  not to be required", and the settings it set are the ones cached in
  victor_ttcur.  So when CLOCAL is on, say the carrier is there.  With

  v9k_backupname() -- the Victor half of upstream edit 21.

  ckufio.c's znewn() makes a unique name by APPENDING ".~<n>~" to the
  fully qualified name it already has, so "A:\RCVDA.DAT" becomes
  "A:\RCVDA.DAT.~1~".  That is two dots and a seven-character extension,
  and MS-DOS cannot create it: FAT holds eight characters, one dot and
  three.  Both of the collision actions that call znewn() -- BACKUP and
  RENAME -- were therefore unavailable on this platform, which is what
  the FILE COLLISION comment further down this file says.

  RENAME is the one that matters, and it is not a preference.  ckcpro.c's
  server-startup code (:503) forces fncact to XYFX_R for the whole session
  whenever DELETE is disabled, "to undo any file collision action that
  could result in deletion or modification of existing files" -- and
  --safe-server disables DELETE.  So every safe server on this machine
  could receive a given filename exactly once, and the second attempt
  failed on a name FAT would not take.  The operator sees an error about
  the FILE, not about the name, which is what makes it worth a fix rather
  than a note.

  What it does instead: replace the extension rather than append to the
  name.  "A:\RCVDA.DAT" -> "A:\RCVDA.001".  The number is found by
  PROBING, not by expanding a wildcard the way upstream does, and the
  reason is the same defect one level down: nzxpand() would be asked to
  match "A:\RCVDA.DAT.~*~", a pattern no FAT directory can ever contain,
  so it would return nothing and the number would always come back 1.
  Probing asks the only question that has an answer here -- does
  "A:\RCVDA.001" exist -- and asks it of access(), which is this file's
  own (see its comment: on DOS the entry either resolves or it does not).

  Numbers run 1..999 and the format is fixed-width, so the extension is
  always exactly three characters and the names sort.  999 backups of one
  name returns 0, and znewn() then falls through to upstream's code and
  produces the name it always did -- which is the pre-edit behaviour, not
  a new failure.

  The name is built in a local and copied back only on success, so a
  caller that gets 0 still holds the name it passed in.  That costs a
  CKMAXPATH-sized frame on a path that upstream already spends one on
  (znewn()'s own buf2[ZNEWNBL+12], which this arm returns before
  reaching), so hard rule 7's budget does not move.

  nap() -- the sub-second delay upstream's msleep() could not make here.

  ckutio.c's msleep() has arms for select(), poll(), usleep(), nap(),
  times(), ftime() and a final fallback; with none of the first three
  defined, this build compiled the fallback, which is

      if (m > 0) while (m > 0) m--;                   ckutio.c:12142

  -- a side-effect-free loop on a local that -os is entitled to delete.
  It was found by a logic analyzer aimed at something else (PORTING.md
  SS16an): a HANGUP that should hold DTR and RTS down for HUPTIME = 500ms
  held them for 175us.  Two shipped things rested on it.  tthang() cannot
  hang up a modem, which is latent because no modem has ever been on this
  bench; and section 1b's tcsendbreak(), which is THIS PORT'S OWN CODE,
  sent a break two IOCTL round trips long where POSIX asks for at least a
  quarter of a second.

  Defining NAP in ckvictor.h moves msleep() onto its nap() arm
  (ckutio.c:12065), so the repair is upstream's own extension point and
  costs no upstream edit.  ckuus5.c:11397 then lists NAP in SHOW FEATURES,
  which is now a true statement about this build.

  WHY IT IS A COUNTED LOOP AND NOT A TIMED ONE.  Hard rule 6 is INT 21h
  only, and INT 21h's clock is AH=2Ch, which on this machine advances in
  500ms steps (PORTING.md SS16n, and v9k_centis() above says the same
  thing at more length).  The one clock available cannot resolve either of
  the two delays that need it -- 275ms and 500ms are both inside a single
  quantum.  So anything shorter than a quantum has to be counted rather
  than timed, which is how this was done in 1980 and is still the only way
  here.  Whole seconds are a different case and are polled against the
  clock below, because a count accumulates error and a poll does not.

  THE CALIBRATION.  The count is a property of the CPU, so it is measured
  at run time rather than written down: sync to a tick edge, then spin in
  chunks until the clock moves again, and divide the iterations by the
  hundredths the move reports.  Reading the delta rather than assuming 50
  is deliberate -- it costs one subtraction and it means a Victor whose
  DOS ticks differently, or an emulator, calibrates itself correctly
  instead of being 10x wrong in silence.

  Three things bias it, and all three are in the safe direction, which is
  why there is no attempt to correct them:

    - the chunk loop reads the clock between chunks and the delay loop
      does not, so the measured rate is LOWER than the true one and the
      spin is very slightly short.  V9K_NAPCHUNK is sized so that one
      INT 21h is ~1% of a chunk, and the 1/16 margin below covers it.
    - interrupts during calibration make the measured rate lower still,
      and interrupts during a delay make the delay longer.  A calibration
      taken on a busy machine over-sleeps later; one taken idle is exact.
    - POSIX asks for AT LEAST the requested time, so long is right and
      short is wrong.  The margin is +1/16, about 6%.

  Calibration is lazy rather than run from an initializer.  It costs up to
  two quanta -- a second -- and the preprocessed build has exactly three
  callers (tthang's msleep(500), one msleep(10), and tcsendbreak here), so
  a run that never hangs up or sends a break never pays it.

  _fmode -- make the DOS runtime stop translating, before main() runs.

  ckufio.c is the UNIX file module.  zopeni() is a bare fopen(name,"r")
  and zopeno() only ever builds "w" or "a"; neither consults the "binary"
  flag, because on Unix there is nothing to consult it for.  On DOS the
  runtime then turns LF into CRLF on the way out and CRLF into LF on the
  way in, and treats ^Z as end of file on input -- which corrupted every
  binary transfer in BOTH directions (PORTING.md SS16h).  All of C-Kermit's
  own end-of-line conversion happens in ckcfns.c under !binary, and with
  "#undef NLCHAR" for VICTOR9K in ckcdeb.h it does none at all, because the
  local line terminator and the wire's are both CRLF.  So the runtime must
  not do it a second time: every stream this program opens wants raw bytes.

  Open Watcom ships binmode.obj to set exactly this.  It does not work in
  this program.  Measured on Victor MS-DOS 3.1 (v9k/probes/vfmode.c,
  v9k/probes/vfmodefp.c): it sets _fmode correctly in a small test program,
  with or without the floating-point emulator linked, and leaves _fmode at
  0100 in CKERMITW.EXE -- with the object the toolchain ships (which is the
  SMALL model build) and equally with the large-model build of the same
  source.  Everything checkable says it should work: its record is in the
  XI table (the table grows 0x3c -> 0x42), cstart runs every priority
  ("mov ax,0FFh"), and _TEXT is one 60,160-byte segment so a near call
  reaches it.  The cause is not known, and rather than ship a mechanism
  that cannot be explained, this file registers its own initializer.

  The difference that matters is FAR.  Watcom's object uses AXIN, the NEAR
  form: rtn_type 0 and a two-byte routine offset, which obliges the walker
  in initrtns.c to reach it with a near call.  clibl.lib is compiled large,
  so struct rt_init there is {type, priority, FAR pointer} -- exactly the
  six bytes below -- and rtn_type 1 asks for the far call that cannot care
  which segment the routine landed in.  The witness is not decoration: it
  is what distinguishes "the initializer never ran" from "it ran and
  something put _fmode back", and access() below reports it into the debug
  log at the one moment it matters.

  Server capabilities, and the command-line switch that chooses how many.

  C-Kermit 11 initialises every ENABLE variable in ckcmai.c to 2, and
  ENABLED() in ckcker.h reads

      (local && (x & 1)) || (!local && (x & 2))

  so 2 means "enabled in remote mode only".  A Victor running

      CKERMITW -l /dev/seriala -b 9600 -x

  OWNS the line, which is exactly what makes it LOCAL -- so every server
  command is disabled.  Measured, PORTING.md SS16i: the first run of server
  mode answered the host's I packet with a correct ACK and then refused
  each command with a well-formed E packet -- "GET disabled", "SEND
  disabled", "FINISH disabled".  The protocol engine and the driver were
  working; the capability gate was shut.

  This is stock upstream policy, not a defect and not something this port
  introduced.  Upstream's own ENABLE help says it: "By default, most
  commands are enabled for REMOTE but disabled for LOCAL to prevent
  security issues."  C-Kermit 9 and 10 shipped these at 3 (both modes);
  11 tightened them, which is why compat_10() above -- SET COMPATIBILITY
  10 -- exists to put them back.

  On a full C-Kermit the answer is to type ENABLE GET at the prompt before
  SERVER.  NOICP removes the prompt, so the decision has to be made at
  startup, and this is where the port makes it:

      CKERMITW -x                  server offers everything it can do
      CKERMITW -x --safe-server    server offers GET, SEND and FINISH only

  The default is the full set -- everything the build can actually perform,
  which is compat_10's list plus DELETE/RMDIR/RETRIEVE/EXIT/BYE.  HOST is
  left alone because NOPUSH already removed the thing it would run, and
  MAIL and PRINT because this build has no transport for either; setting
  those to 3 would only turn a refusal into a failure.

  SPACE and WHO were that same case and this initializer got them wrong
  until PORTING.md SS16ax measured them.  Both were served by syscmd()
  (ckcpro.w's <generic>U and <generic>W), syscmd() is a shell pipe, and
  NOPUSH compiles its body away to "return(0)" -- so a Victor server that
  advertised them could only ever answer "Can't check space" and "Can't do
  who command", which is exactly the failure-instead-of-refusal the
  paragraph above was written to avoid.

  WHO is zeroed rather than merely left alone: the default is 2, and 2
  prints as "Remote only" in the server's own REMOTE HELP table (nm[] at
  ckcfns.c:3), where 0 prints as "Disabled" alongside HOST, MAIL and
  PRINT.  Zeroing is also what upstream itself does to en_hos under
  NOPUSH (ckcmai.c:1596).  Nothing on a single-user DOS machine could
  answer it anyway.

  SPACE was zeroed for one build and is enabled again, because it was the
  one of the two worth having: upstream edit 20 gives ckcpro.w and
  ckcfns.c a VICTOR9K arm that asks DOS directly (INT 21h AH=36h,
  v9k_dskspace() in section 1d) instead of running df(1).

  --safe-server is
  for a line whose far end is not entirely yours: it grants the three
  commands a file transfer needs and nothing that manipulates the Victor's
  file system.  Note the asymmetry -- en_ena stays at its default under
  --safe-server, so a peer cannot ENABLE its way back out of it.

  TWO OF THESE VARIABLES HAVE NO READER AT ALL AND IT IS WORTH SAYING SO,
  because a capability gate that is set and never consulted looks like
  protection and is not.  Neither is a port defect and only one is a
  defect at all:

    en_ena  is read at ckuus6.c:7227, where the ENABLE command guards
            itself, and printed by SHOW at ckuus5.c:7273.  Both are
            #ifndef NOICP, so it is simply inert in a shipping build --
            there is no prompt to type ENABLE at.  Setting it costs
            nothing and keeps a KEEP_ICP build honest.

    en_ret  is UPSTREAM'S, and it is a defect: ckuus6.c:7115 assigns it
            from ENABLE/DISABLE RETRIEVE, and nothing anywhere reads it.
            RETRIEVE is gated by en_del instead (ckcpro.w:645 and :690),
            and ckcfns.c:6186 has en_ret COMMENTED OUT of REMOTE HELP's
            extern list, so the command does not even advertise it.
            DISABLE RETRIEVE therefore succeeds and does nothing on every
            platform.  Reported upstream with edits 14-17; nothing to fix
            here, and the port's own safety does not rest on it, because
            --safe-server leaves en_del off and en_del is the gate that
            is actually consulted.

  MAIL and PRINT are the other side of the same coin and they are the one
  place this table now MEANS what it says: both are 0 (ckcmai.c:1613 and
  :1614) and this initializer never touches them, but until upstream edit
  22 the MAIL half of that was decorative -- gattr()'s case 'M' sat inside
  an #ifndef NOFRILLS while case 'P' did not, so en_mai was read on no
  path this build compiles.  PORTING.md SS16bb.

  These variables are read only by the server-command handlers in
  ckcpro.w, so a -s, -r or -g run never consults them; setting them here
  costs those invocations nothing.

  HOW THE SWITCH IS PARSED, because it is not obvious and it is not a
  tenth upstream edit.  ckuusy.c's cmdlin() would call XFATAL on an option
  it does not know, so upstream must never see this one.  Open Watcom's
  cstart (bld/clib/startup/a/cstrt086.asm) copies the DOS command tail from
  PSP:81h to the bottom of the stack and leaves a far pointer to the copy
  in _LpCmdLine, all BEFORE it calls __InitRtns -- and on 16-bit targets
  argv itself is built by an XI initializer, __Init_Argv, at
  INIT_PRIORITY_THREAD, which is 1 (bld/clib/startup/c/argcv.c,
  bld/watcom/h/rtprior.h).  __InitRtns always runs the lowest priority not
  yet done, so a record at priority 0 runs before argv exists.  This one
  reads the copy, records the switch, and blanks it with spaces; argv is
  then built from a command line that no longer contains it, and cmdlin()
  parses what it expects.

  Priority 0 also means the floating-point and run-time initializers have
  not run yet, so this routine calls nothing -- no libc, and in particular
  no debug(), because the log is not open.  What it decides is reported
  from uname() instead, which sysinit() reaches in EVERY invocation --
  including "CKERMITW -d -h", which writes a debug log and exits without
  opening the line, so the switch is checkable in one 2.5-minute boot with
  no serial line and no host.  "v9k srvcaps safe" in DEBUG.LOG is the
  witness: 0 for the full set, 1 for --safe-server.

  The file output buffer size, for the same reason and by the same mechanism.

  ckcker.h defines OBUFSIZE as 1024 on the branch this build takes, and
  defines it UNGUARDED, so ckvictor.h cannot pre-empt it the way it does
  DRPSIZ.  It does not need to.  OBUFSIZE is read exactly twice -- to give
  the int zobufsize its initial value (ckcmai.c:1652), and to bound SET
  BUFFERS, which NOICP removes.  The two places that move bytes both read
  the variable:

      getiobs()   malloc(zobufsize)              ckcmai.c:3795
      zmchout()   flush when zoutcnt >= zobufsize  ckcker.h

  calls getiobs() at ckcmai.c:3331, well after sysinit() at 3176 -- but
  sysinit() is ckutio.c, which is stock, so the earliest hook this port owns
  is the XI table.  Priority 32 rather than 0 because unlike --safe-server
  this has nothing to say about argv and every reason to want the runtime up:
  it is a plain int store, but the buffer it sizes is malloc'd later.

  What it costs is far heap, not DGROUP -- zoutbuffer is a char * under
  DYNAMIC and malloc() is _fmalloc in the large model, so rule 4's second
  budget is the one that pays.  What it is FOR, and how to tell whether it
  worked, is the comment on V9K_OBUFSIZE in ckvictor.h: PORTING.md SS16m
  measured 32 writes and 3.5-7.0 seconds, and the "v9k: wfile" line at exit

  Control-character prefixing, and this is a throughput change rather than a
  correctness one.  PORTING.md SS16v measured the bound as the foreground
  decode path -- 564us per RECEIVED WIRE byte against a 260us byte time --
  so the cheapest thing that can be done for it is to make fewer wire bytes
  arrive.  Every one of them is paid for four times over: the interrupt
  handler stores it, v9k_ser_get() copies it, chk3() runs it through the
  CRC and bdecode() decodes it.

  Upstream initialises prefixing = PX_ALL (ckcmai.c:1312, because this build
  does not define NEWDEFAULTS), which asks the far end to prefix every
  control character.  SS16w measured what that costs on the all-byte-values
  fixture: 32,768 payload bytes went out as 37,568 wire bytes, 14.7% of them
  prefixes.  PX_CAU is upstream's own "cautious" setting and it is cautious
  in exactly the ways that matter to a serial line -- setprefix() keeps CR,
  XON/XOFF, IAC, DEL and the packet-start character prefixed (ckcmai.c:2699)
  and re-prefixes XON/XOFF on its own if flow control ever becomes FLO_XONX
  (2705), so selecting it here does not have to be revisited when SS16v's
  flow-control work lands.

  CK_SPEED is what compiles the machinery, and it is on: ckcdeb.h:3385
  defines it unless NOCKSPEED, which ckvictor.h does not.

  Why an initializer rather than a line in ckvictor.h: prefixing is a
  variable with an upstream initialiser, not a #define, so pre-empting it
  would be an upstream edit.  Under NOICP there is no SET PREFIXING to type,
  which is the same hole SS16i's server capabilities fell down and the same
  way out.  Priority 32 for the reason the obufsize record gives: this has
  nothing to say about argv and every reason to want the runtime up.

  WHY IT WRITES ptab AND NOT JUST prefixing, which is the whole point of
  this comment.  Setting the variable alone did nothing for eleven weeks and
  the wire says so.  main() reaches, in this order:

      ckcmai.c:3295   initproto(PROTO_K, ...)
                        -> if (ptab[protocol].prefix > -1)
                               prefixing = ptab[protocol].prefix;
      ckcmai.c:3413   setprefix(prefixing)

  ptab[PROTO_K].prefix is statically PX_ALL (ckcmai.c:719, the #else of
  NEWDEFAULTS, which this build does not define), and PX_ALL is 0, so the
  "> -1" test passes and initproto OVERWRITES anything an XI initializer put
  in prefixing -- 118 lines before the value is read.  Upstream knows this
  about itself: the comment at ckcmai.c:3319 says compat_9()/compat_10() run
  "after initproto calls so initial file transfer settings are not
  overwritten."  An XI record runs before main() and therefore before
  initproto, which is the one place that ordering does not hold.

  So the durable place to say it is ptab, which initproto copies FROM.
  Writing prefixing as well is not redundant: it is what a build with no
  initproto call for PROTO_K would use, and it keeps the two agreeing for
  anything that reads the variable before main() gets that far.

  HOW THIS WAS FOUND, because the method generalises: not by reading the
  source, which had been read twice and produced the comment this replaces,
  but by decoding the prefix characters out of a packet log.  A run's
  ctlp[] table is recoverable from the wire -- every value the sender
  prefixed appears after a QCTL -- and 16ah leg BS prefixed exactly the 66
  values setprefix() sets for PX_ALL while the host, over the identical
  fixture in the same session, prefixed exactly the 32 it sets for PX_CAU.
  8,869 prefix characters against 4,512, and the 4,357 difference is the
  whole of the send leg's wire-byte excess.  v9k/tools/pktstat.py counts
  them.  A setting that is applied and then quietly overwritten looks
  exactly like a setting that was never right; only the wire tells them
  apart.

  Which setting is V9K_PREFIXING in ckvictor.h.  It stays a knob because
  this change needs a control, and now it has a real one:
  XFLAGS="-dV9K_PREFIXING=PX_ALL" reproduces the behaviour every leg in this
  project up to and including 16ah actually ran, whatever its binary said.

  UNMEASURED ON THE WIRE.  Every published send figure in this project was
  taken with PX_ALL in force, so 16ah leg BS's "+24.3% against the host's
  +9.7%" is a measurement of PX_ALL against PX_CAU and not, as that section
  has it, of two ends disagreeing about one policy.  What this fix predicts
  is that a Victor send drops from 8,869 prefix characters to about 4,512 --
  count them, do not time them, because 4,357 bytes is ~1.1 s at 38400 and
  the bench does not repeat to better than ~1.3 s.

  FILE COLLISION, and this one is a defect rather than a preference.

  What this build actually did was REFUSE -- ptab[PROTO_K].fnca is
  XYFX_D for everything but VMS (ckcmai.c:727) and initproto() copies it
  over the XYFX_B at ckcmai.c:1326 before anything reads either.  See the
  ordering note below, which is where that was established and where the
  first version of this comment was wrong.

  Two of the six policies are unavailable here whatever is chosen, and it
  is worth writing down because BACKUP is upstream's documented default
  and someone will reach for it: BACKUP and RENAME both go through
  znewn(), whose only name form is "name.~N~" (ckufio.c:4000) -- two dots
  and a four-character extension, which FAT cannot hold.  That leaves
  APPEND, DISCARD and REPLACE.

  THE SYMPTOM IS WORTH KNOWING BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A PORT DEFECT.  The
  host sends S, F, A and then Z with data "D" -- no data packets at all, a
  ~287-byte packet log -- and the Victor's screen says "No files were
  transferred (refused: destination file already exists)".  It has voided
  two bench sittings of this project's own legs (NEXT_SESSION.md's harness
  notes), both times on a re-run into a name a previous leg had created.

  REPLACE is the default here for three reasons and the third is the weak
  one, so it is labelled:

    1. It is the DOS convention.  MS-DOS Kermit 3.13, which is the sibling
       implementation for this exact machine, overwrites.
    2. The behaviour it replaces is a flat refusal, which is the status
       quo that has already misled this project twice -- and once more
       during the leg that verified this very change (leg NB).
    3. Upstream itself picks REPLACE for VMS.  Which is a weaker argument
       than it looks: VMS versions files itself, so REPLACE there loses
       nothing, and here it does.

  So the cost is real and is stated rather than hidden: a RECEIVE into an
  existing name now overwrites it silently.  XFLAGS=-dV9K_COLLISION=XYFX_D
  puts the old effective behaviour back without an edit, and a KEEP_ICP
  build has SET FILE COLLISION.

  IT WRITES ptab, AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS DID NOT.  SS16ai's trap,
  walked into a second time and caught by the counter that was added
  specifically to catch it: leg NB came back "v9k: coll=4" after an
  initializer that had assigned 1.  initproto() does

      ckcmai.c:2026   if (ptab[protocol].fnca > -1)
                          fncact = ptab[protocol].fnca;

  and ptab[PROTO_K].fnca is statically XYFX_D (ckcmai.c:727), which is
  > -1, so it overwrites whatever an XI record put in the variable -- the
  same shape, in the same function, as the prefixing defect above.  So the
  durable place is ptab, and the variable is written as well for the same
  reason it is there.

  AND THAT CORRECTS THE STORY IN THIS COMMENT.  ckcmai.c:1326 sets fncact
  = XYFX_B, and this file used to say the port therefore shipped BACKUP
  and degraded to a refusal when znewn() built a name FAT cannot hold.
  It never got that far: initproto() replaced XYFX_B with XYFX_D before
  anything read it, so the shipped behaviour has always been a FLAT
  REFUSAL, znewn() has never been called, and the FAT argument -- while
  true of BACKUP -- was not the mechanism.  The observable is identical,
  which is why the wrong explanation survived: "refused: destination file
  already exists" is what both produce.

  The other writers of fncact are ckcfn3.c's temporary switch to APPEND
  for recovery (1809/1985/2630, which restores it) and ckcfns.c:7397,
  which is a REMOTE SET arriving from a peer.  Neither runs at startup.

  Flow control's command-line switches.  Section 1f is the driver; this is

      CKERMITW --xonxoff    XON/XOFF, both directions
      CKERMITW --noflow     none, and this is the shipping default

  Same mechanism as --safe-server and for the same reason: NOICP removes SET
  FLOW, and cmdlin() would XFATAL on an option it does not know, so the
  switch has to be read and blanked out of Watcom's copy of the DOS command
  tail BEFORE __Init_Argv builds argv at priority 1.  The comment on
  v9k_set_srvcaps() above has the mechanism in full, including why nothing
  in here may call libc.

  --noflow exists even though it is the default, and it is not redundant:
  it is the control leg.  A binary built with -dV9K_FLOW=FLO_RTSC can be
  made to run with flow control off without rebuilding, which is what makes
  an A/B one binary and one switch rather than two binaries -- and SS16w
  established that this machine is sensitive enough to code size that two
  binaries is a confound.

  It is also the answer to SS16i's rule about running the unknown-option
  control: an option this initializer does NOT recognise stays in the
  command tail and reaches cmdlin(), which fatals on it.  So "CKERMITW
  --rtscts" starting normally and "CKERMITW --rtsctz" fatalling is the pair
  that distinguishes "recognised" from "silently ignored".

  WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT DONE HERE.  This does not write flow, cxflow[] or
  anything else upstream owns -- initflow() would overwrite all of it at
  ckcmai.c:3269, which is the trap SS16ai wrote up.  It records the choice
  in v9k_flowsel and v9k_ser_install() applies it at the one moment that
  survives.

  --nodisplay -- turn the file-transfer display off for one run.

      CKERMITW --nodisplay -l /dev/seriala -b 38400 -r

  §16ap measured what the fullscreen display costs and the answer is
  **4-5 seconds per 32 KB transfer at any line rate** -- 4.188 s receiving
  at 38400 against a control spread of 0.310 s, 5.035 s sending, 4.395 s
  receiving at 9600. It is console-write time, so it does not scale with
  the wire; only the percentage moves, from 7.7% at 9600 to 22.6% on a
  38400 send. The run sheet's decision rule said an effect over 5% licenses
  a switch, and it did.

  IT IS NOT THE ONLY WAY OFF, and the other one is worth knowing because it
  is what §16ao's own control legs used: **redirect stdout**. `xxscreen()`
  tests `!backgrd`, `conbgt()` derives `backgrd` from `isatty(0) &&
  isatty(1)`, so `CKERMITW ... > NUL` suppresses the display with no code at
  all. What this switch adds is the ability to suppress the display while
  KEEPING stdout on the console -- so the `v9k:` counters and any error
  still reach the operator's screen, which a redirect takes away and which
  MS-DOS 3.1 cannot give back (it will not redirect handle 2).

  WHY IT WRITES fdispla AND WHY THAT IS SAFE. XYFD_N is upstream's own
  "SET FILE DISPLAY NONE", tested by the `xxscreen()` macro before
  `ckscreen()` is even called, so the whole display costs one compare per
  packet when it is off. §16ai's trap -- an XI record writing a variable
  upstream re-initialises later -- was checked rather than assumed: every
  other writer of `fdispla` in this build is either a static initializer,
  inside `fxdinit()`, or in the parser. And **`fxdinit()` is unreachable
  once this is XYFD_N**: its only live caller is `ckscreen()`
  (`ckuusx.c:4629`), which the macro gate stops; the three in `ck_cls()`
  and friends are in the `#ifndef NOTERMCAP` / `#ifndef CK_CURPOS` region
  this build excludes (§1g); the rest are `SET FILE DISPLAY` in `ckuus7.c`.
  So nothing writes it after this and there is no ordering to lose.

  Priority 0, like --safe-server and the flow switch, and it blanks the
  token out of Watcom's copy of the DOS tail before `argv` is built so
  `cmdlin()` never sees an option it would reject.

  --nobulk -- put ttinl()'s per-byte loop back for one run.

      CKERMITW --nobulk -l /dev/seriala -b 38400 -r

  UPSTREAM EDIT 18 (ckutio.c) reads a whole buffered run out of mybuf[]
  with memchr()/memcpy() instead of walking it a byte at a time through
  the myread() macro.  This switch is its control, and the reason it is a
  runtime switch rather than a build flag is §16ap's: a control built from
  a SECOND BINARY is also a control for §16w's code-size sensitivity, and
  this project has spent whole legs establishing that the rebuild was not
  what moved.  With one binary and one switch there is nothing for that to
  act on -- the treatment and the control are the same 8088 instructions
  in the same places, differing in one compare outside the loop.

  v9k_bulkn IS NOT DECORATION.  It counts the runs the arm actually
  copied, and it exists because equivalence CANNOT be observed from the
  outside: an arm that is correct returns the byte loop's answer whether
  or not it was supposed to run, so a --nobulk that silently failed to
  take effect would produce a control leg identical to the treatment and
  a null result that looked like a real one.  v9k/proofs/vttinl.c found
  exactly that -- a mutation deleting the switch from the gate escaped
  every equivalence case in the file until the counter existed.  This is
  the same role `wcon n=` plays for the display (§16ao): 0 means the arm
  never ran, non-zero means it did.  READ IT ON EVERY LEG.

  It is also the trap §16ap walked into, one level up: "--nobulk" against
  a binary that does not have the switch answers "Extended options not
  configured", which is the same string the unknown-option control is
  supposed to produce.  Run the control (§16i) and check the counter.

  --window=N -- open the sliding window for one run.  PORTING.md SS1 item 12.

      CKERMITW --window=2 -l /dev/seriala -b 38400 -r

  DFWSIZ has been 1 for the port's whole life and ckvictor.h says why: with
  one packet in flight the far end is silent from the end of a packet until
  its ACK comes back, so nothing arrives while the 8088 is decoding and
  writing, and the 4,096-byte ring is safe by construction rather than by
  flow control.  That is also the cost -- line and foreground are strictly
  SERIALIZED, 9.77 s and 15.90 s of a 25.66 s receive (SS16aq), and a window
  is the only thing that overlaps them.

  A RUNTIME SWITCH RATHER THAN A REBUILD, and that is SS16aq's lesson taken
  at its word: a control built from a second binary is also a control for
  SS16w's code-size sensitivity, and this project has spent whole legs
  establishing that the rebuild was not what moved.  --window=1 against
  --window=2 is one binary, one immediate, nothing for SS16w to act on.

  IT WRITES ptab, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT -- the same trap that ate the
  prefixing setting for the port's entire life (SS16ai, v9k_set_prefixing()
  above).  main() reaches initproto(PROTO_K,...) at ckcmai.c:3295, which
  does

      if (ptab[protocol].winsize > -1)
          wslotr = ptab[protocol].winsize;      (ckcmai.c:2021)

  118 lines before anything reads wslotr.  An XI record runs before main(),
  which is exactly the position from which writing the VARIABLE is undone.
  wslotr is set too, but ptab is the one that does the work.

  THE POOL IS THE CEILING, AND IT IS 2.  Nothing in this build calls
  adjpkl() for the receive direction: dofast() is guarded out (SS8 item 14)
  and the two other callers are REMOTE SET handlers.  So urpsiz stays at
  DRPSIZ while makebuf() divides RBSIZ by the slot count, and the condition
  nobody else is going to check is

      (DRPSIZ + 6) x slots <= RBSIZ        4,006 x 2 = 8,012 <= 8,192

  which ckvictor.h's SBSIZ/RBSIZ comment says was the intent all along:
  "at window 1 it is twice what it needs -- deliberately, so that turning
  the window up to 2 later is a one-line change".  It is, and this is it.
  A larger window needs larger pools, which are far heap and cost load RAM
  rather than DGROUP -- do not raise them until a leg says a window pays.

  CLAMPED RATHER THAN REFUSED, and REPORTED EITHER WAY.  Shrinking DRPSIZ to
  fit, which is what upstream's adjpkl() would do, would change the packet
  length between the two arms and confound the thing being measured.  So the
  window is clamped instead and the exit line prints what was asked for
  beside what took effect -- SS16aq's rule, that a switch which silently
  failed produces a control identical to the treatment and a null result
  that looks real.  READ v9k: window ON EVERY LEG.

  WHAT TO EXPECT, so that a bad leg is recognisable.  The ring stops being
  safe by construction: through the whole "dec" interval above the far end
  is sending and nothing is draining, so rxpeak should rise from SS16aq's
  459 to about (dec tot / dec n) x 38.46 bytes at 38400.  If that exceeds
  4,096, rxfull goes non-zero and the protocol resends -- byte-exact still,
  but slower, which is the shape SS16ae saw at block 3.  RUN IT UNDER MAME
  AT 9600 FIRST, where the foreground is faster than the line and the ring
  cannot fill, so the leg tests the negotiation and the protocol only.

      TWO CEILINGS, AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS.  SS16as ran

      at 4,095 and lost bytes on every leg, and the arithmetic that would
      have predicted it is one line:

        a window of W lets the far end have W unacknowledged packets, so
        in-flight bytes are HARD-BOUNDED at W x (packet wire length) --
        structurally, not statistically -- and the ring has to hold that
        many, because nothing drains it while the foreground decodes.

      2 x 3,998 = 7,996 into 4,096.  Overflow was certain before the leg
      ran.  The first version of this switch checked only the buffer POOL,
      which said 2 was fine, and the pool was never the binding constraint.

      Note what the ring ceiling says about the shipping build: at
      DRPSIZ = 4000 it is 4096/4008 = 1, i.e. THIS BUILD CANNOT USEFULLY
      OPEN A WINDOW AT ALL, and --window=2 now clamps to 1 and says so
      rather than reproducing SS16as.  Shortening the packet is what buys
      the headroom -- at DRPSIZ = 1800 the ring holds 2 -- and that costs
      no DGROUP and no assembly, which is why it is the experiment to run
      before spending either.  See PORTING.md SS16as.

  access().  Watcom HAS one; it is wrong about the directory you are in
  when that directory is the root, which is where CKERMITW normally runs.

  Its implementation (bld/clib/file/c/accss.c) is two lines:

      if (_dos_getfileattr(path,&attrs)) return(-1);
      if ((attrs & _A_RDONLY) && pmode == W_OK) return(EACCES);
      return(0);

  -- INT 21h AH=43h, and then the read-only bit.  But a FAT root directory
  has no directory entry of its own, so AH=43h has nothing to read for it.
  It does not fail: it SUCCEEDS and hands back a garbage attribute word,
  measured on Victor MS-DOS 3.1 as 006b for ".", "./", ".\", "\", "A:\"
  and "A:.", as 00ff for "\" seen from a subdirectory, and as 0000 for
  "A:\" seen from the same place.  006b has the read-only bit set and does
  NOT have the directory bit, so Watcom takes the second branch and reports
  EACCES for the directory the program is sitting in.  A named subdirectory
  answers cleanly (0010), and so does "." once the current directory is one.

  That broke RECEIVE outright.  ckufio.c's zchko() creates the incoming
  file, deletes it again, and only then asks access(".",W_OK) whether it
  may create files there; the answer came back no and rcvfil() turned it
  into the protocol error "Write access denied" (PORTING.md SS16h).

  So: for W_OK, a directory is writeable.  That is not a workaround, it is
  what DOS means -- there are no per-directory permissions, and the
  read-only attribute of a directory entry does not stop you creating files
  inside it.  Directory-ness is decided with stat(), which SS16f already
  established answers "." here where libdos-m's did not, and which the same
  probe shows answering every spelling of the root correctly.  Everything
  else keeps Watcom's semantics, with one bug not copied: the library tests
  "pmode == W_OK", so it skips the read-only check for R_OK|W_OK.

  For F_OK and R_OK the getfileattr call has already answered the question
  -- the entry either resolves or it does not -- and DOS has no unreadable
  files.

  MS-DOS Kermit 3.13 shows on this machine, it needs only a handful of
  curses primitives, and on the Victor those primitives are four escape
  sequences written to the console with ordinary INT 21h.  No curses
  library, no termcap, no screen memory, no INT 10h.

  The sequences are the machine's documented set -- DEC VT52 with Heath Z19
  extensions -- and NOT ANSI, which this console does not interpret:

      cursor to (row, col)   ESC Y (row+0x20) (col+0x20)
      erase to end of line   ESC K
      erase to end of screen ESC J
      erase whole screen     ESC E   (cursor goes home)

  The +0x20 offset is the VT52 encoding: coordinates travel as printable
  characters, so row 0 column 0 is ESC Y SP SP.  msxv90.asm:1100 (POSCUR)
  does exactly this with AH=09h then AH=02h twice, and vickermit.c:195 does
  it in C as printf("\033Y%c%c", x+31, y+31) -- +31 there because its
  coordinates are 1-based and ours, like curses', are 0-based.

  WHY THESE GO THROUGH conol(), AND THE fflush() THAT HAS TO GO WITH IT.

  conol() is ckutio.c's console writer, so it lands on section 0e's write
  path and is counted by the "v9k: wcon" line at exit -- which is how the
  display's cost gets measured at all, since printf() inside Watcom's libc
  calls its own write and never reaches our wrapper (ckvictor.h's "#define
  write v9k_write" renames the call in C-Kermit's sources only).

  But the FIELD TEXT does not come this way.  screenc() writes it with
  printw(), which victorow/curses.h makes printf(), which is buffered by
  Watcom's stdio -- so there are two output paths to one console and the
  cursor addresses arrive in a different order than the text they position.
  Measured, not reasoned about: the first build of this section put a
  fullscreen display on the Victor whose fields were all correct and all
  concatenated onto two lines, because every ESC Y overtook the printf
  output it was meant to place.

  So each sequence flushes stdout first, and refresh() -- which upstream
  calls after every field group and which a no-op curses would ignore --
  does the same.  That is what refresh() MEANS here: not "repaint from an
  image", there is no image, but "make the console actually show what has
  been written".  The alternative, routing printw() through conol() as
  well, needs a vsprintf buffer on a 64K DGROUP and buys nothing this does
  not.

  The cost is one fflush per positioning call, which is a libc test-and-
  return when the buffer is empty.

  ESC E vs ESC J for clear().  Upstream's own VT52 arm does move(0,0) then
  erase-to-end-of-screen, which is correct but is two writes and leaves the
  cursor placement implicit.  ESC E is the Victor's own "erase entire screen
  and home the cursor" (Supplementary Technical Reference Manual), one
  sequence, and it is what msxv90.asm's CMBLNK sends.

  THE OTHER DOS DOES NOT SPEAK VT52, and this is the port's first
  behavioural difference between the two of them.

  Everything above is measured on Victor MS-DOS 3.1, whose console driver
  is the Victor's own and takes ESC Y / ESC E / ESC K.  FreeDOS for Victor
  supplies its own console driver instead, and it is an ANSI one:
  myfreedos/kernel/victor_ansi.asm parses ESC '[' and nothing else --
  "Not '[' - abort sequence, pass through character" at line 154.  So on
  FreeDOS the VT52 form does not merely fail to move the cursor, it PRINTS:
  a 'Y' and two coordinate bytes land on the screen as text, 55 times a
  repaint.

  What that driver does support is listed in its own header and it covers
  exactly the three sequences this section needs:

      ESC[row;colH   set cursor position, 1-BASED
      ESC[2J         clear entire screen
      ESC[K          clear from cursor to end of line

  so the fix is a dialect switch and not a reduced display.  It is chosen
  from the same INT 21h AH=30h probe that picks the IRQ1 vector (section
  1e), for the same reason: one question, one answer, no way for the two
  to disagree.  XFLAGS=-dV9K_CON_FORCE_ANSI and -dV9K_CON_FORCE_VT52
  override it, which is how this gets tested on either machine.

  UNVERIFIED ON FREEDOS.  The ANSI arm is written from that driver's
  source and its supported-sequence list; no FreeDOS-for-Victor run has
  ever been made with this build.  The VT52 arm is the one with hardware
  behind it (PORTING.md SS16ao, SS16ap).  Cursor homing after the clear is
  spelled out as ESC[1;1H rather than left to ESC[2J, because that
  driver's clear does not document where it leaves the cursor and an
  explicit two-sequence clear costs four bytes once per transfer.

  ck_cls(), ck_cleol(), ck_curpos() -- SCREEN CLEAR / CLEOL / MOVE, and the

  Upstream has a fallback for them at ckuusx.c:7055, reached when neither
  termcap nor MYCURSES has supplied CK_CURPOS.  Two things are wrong with
  taking it here, and only the first is ours to care about:

    1. It emits ANSI -- printf("\033[%d;%dH") -- which this console does not
       interpret.  SCREEN CLEAR would print "[2J" and leave the screen
       alone.  Exactly the defect victorow/curses.h was written to avoid,
       one layer up.

    2. It does not compile.  ckuusx.c:7070 declares
       "ck_curpos(row, col) int row, int col;", which is not valid K&R --
       the second "int" is a syntax error, not a style.  Every other build
       reaches CK_CURPOS through termcap or MYCURSES first, so nothing has
       ever compiled this block.  Reported, not edited: defining CK_CURPOS
       here is a smaller change than touching upstream and it is what this
       port needs anyway.

  So section 1g owns them, in the machine's own dialect.  ck_curpos()'s
  arguments are 1-based -- ckuusr.c:13721 passes what the user typed at
  "SCREEN MOVE row col" -- where move() above is 0-based like curses, which
  is why this is not simply a call through.

  THIS IS LOAD-BEARING, and the comment that used to sit here said the
  opposite.  It claimed the only surviving caller, rq_confirm_check() in
  ckcfns.c, "calls this ONLY when SET RECEIVE CONFIRM has been turned on --

    - A Victor driving its own serial line IS local, so rq_confirm_check()

  things SS16x found standing between this port and KEEP_ICP.

  WHAT THE CALLER ACTUALLY WANTS decides how much of it has to be rebuilt,

  Integer syntax only, therefore, and no floatval.  Under NOFLOAT the
  keyword tables that reach nlookup() are integer tables, so a fraction
  would be a defect in the caller rather than input this should accept --
  but the contract's return of 2 for "has a fractional part" is honoured
  anyway, because answering 1 to a number this build cannot represent would
  be a lie of exactly the kind SS16x was about.

  Only in a KEEP_SPL build, and the coupling is worth stating because it is
  not obvious that scripting should depend on a terminal emulator at all.

  doinput() -- the script INPUT command -- logs what it reads to the session
  log, and it wants to leave ANSI escape sequences out of that log.  So at
  ckuus4.c:7309 it calls chkaes() and reads inesc[]/oldesc[], the CONNECT
  module's escape-sequence recognizer state:

      if (noescseq) {
          dummy = chkaes(c,0);
          if (inesc[0] != ES_NORMAL || oldesc[0] != ES_NORMAL)
            skip = 1;
      }

  All three live in ckucns.c, which this port does not build -- there is no
  terminal emulation here, and rule 6 (INT 21h only) is most of why.  The
  reference survives because it is guarded by "#ifndef NOLOCAL", and NOLOCAL
  has to stay undefined: it is what gives us local mode and SET LINE, which
  is how the program owns a serial port at all.  So the guard that would
  have removed this is one we cannot use.

  WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS, rather than what merely links: with no terminal
  emulator this program is NEVER inside an escape sequence, so nothing
  should ever be skipped from the session log.  That means both arrays read
  ES_NORMAL and chkaes() reports "no APC to execute".

  Note that ckucns.c initialises oldesc[] to -1 and NOT to ES_NORMAL, and
  copying that would be a defect here: the test above is an OR, so a -1 in
  oldesc[0] makes skip = 1 and the session log silently drops every
  character INPUT ever reads.  ES_NORMAL is 0 (ckucns.c:348) and is what
  both arrays want.

/* 3. TO BE IMPLEMENTED against real Victor hardware                    */

/*
  NOTHING BELOW THIS LINE IS A STUB YOU CAN SHIP.

  These are the functions that actually have to work for the milestone
  (SET LINE / SET SPEED / SEND / RECEIVE / GET / SERVER).  They are
  listed here as a checklist; the real implementations live in
  ckutio.c and ckufio.c, which compile clean already, and which reach the
  hardware through the Open Watcom DOS runtime and this file:

    Console  (ckutio.c -> INT 21h, via the Watcom runtime)
      coninc(timeout)   read one char from keyboard, timeout in seconds
      conchk()          how many chars are waiting (0 if none)
      conoc(c)          write one char to screen
      conol(s)          write a string to screen
      congm()/concb()/conres()  save / set cbreak / restore console mode

    Serial   (ckutio.c -> your termios layer or Victor serial API)
      ttopen(name,&local,modem,timo)   open the serial port
      ttclos(x)                        close it
      ttpkt(speed,flow,parity)         put line in packet mode
      ttinc(timo) / ttinl(...)         read
      ttoc(c) / ttol(s,n)              write
      ttsspd(speed)                    SET SPEED  (38400 and up)
      ttflui()                         flush input

    Timing   (ckutio.c)
      rtimer()/gtimer()  elapsed seconds, from the Victor tick counter
      ztime(&s)          wall-clock time string

    Files    (ckufio.c -> Watcom open/read/write/lseek/stat)
      zopeni/zopeno/zinfill/zsoutx/zclose/zchki  -- these are already
      written in portable terms and should need no Victor changes.

  The point of this port is that all of the above already exist in
  ckutio.c/ckufio.c in portable POSIX form.  What this file supplies is
  the layer underneath them, not new C-Kermit code.
