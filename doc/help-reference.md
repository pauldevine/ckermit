## Introductory Material

### INTRO

```
Welcome to UNIX C-Kermit communications software for:
 . Error-free and efficient file transfer
 . Terminal connection
 . Script programming
 . International character set conversion
 . Numeric and alphanumeric paging
 
Supporting:
 . Serial connections, direct or dialed.
 . Automatic modem dialing
 . TCP/IP network connections:
   - Telnet sessions
   - SSH connections via external agent
   - Rlogin sessions
   - FTP sessions
   - HTTP 1.1 sessions
   - Internet Kermit Service
 
While typing commands, you may use the following special characters:
 . DEL, RUBOUT, BACKSPACE, CTRL-H: Delete the most recent character typed.
 . CTRL-W:      Delete the most recent word typed.
 . CTRL-U:      Delete the current line.
 . CTRL-R:      Redisplay the current line.
 . CTRL-P:      Command recall - go backwards in command recall buffer.
 . CTRL-B:      Command recall - same as Ctrl-P.
 . CTRL-N:      Command recall - go forward in command recall buffer.
 . CTRL-K:      Insert the most recently entered local file specifiction.
 . ?            (question mark) Display a menu for the current command field.
 . ESC          (or TAB or Ctrl-I) Attempt to complete the current field.
 . \            (backslash) include the following character literally
                or introduce a backslash code, variable, or function.
 
IMPORTANT: Since backslash (\) is Kermit's command-line escape character,
you must enter DOS, Windows, or OS/2 pathnames using either forward slash (/)
or double backslash (\\) as the directory separator in most contexts.
Examples: C:/TMP/README.TXT, C:\\TMP\\README.TXT.
 
Command words other than filenames can be abbreviated in most contexts.

```

### APC

```
Syntax: APC text
  Echoes the text within a VT220/320/420 Application Program Command.
```

### ARRAY

```
Syntax: ARRAY verb operands...
 
Declares arrays and performs various operations on them.  Arrays have
the following syntax:
 
  \&a[n]
 
where "a" is a letter and n is a number or a variable with a numeric value
or an arithmetic expression.  The value of an array element can be anything
at all -- a number, a character, a string, a filename, etc.
 
The following ARRAY verbs are available:
 
[ ARRAY ] DECLARE arrayname[n] [ = initializers... ]
  Declares an array of the given size, n.  The resulting array has n+1
  elements, 0 through n.  Array elements can be used just like any other
  variables.  Initial values can be given for elements 1, 2, ... by
  including = followed by one or more values separated by spaces.  If you
  omit the size, the array is sized according to the number of initializers;
  if none are given the array is destroyed and undeclared if it already
  existed.  The ARRAY keyword is optional.  Synonym: [ ARRAY ] DCL.
 
[ ARRAY ] UNDECLARE arrayname
  Destroys and undeclares the given array.  Synonym: ARRAY DESTROY.
 
ARRAY SHOW [ arrayname ]
  Displays the contents of the given array.  A range specifier can be
  included to display a segment of the array, e.g. "array show \&a[1:24]."
  If the arrayname is omitted, all declared arrays are listed, but their
  contents is not shown.  Synonym: SHOW ARRAY.
 
ARRAY CLEAR arrayname
  Clears all elements of the array, i.e. sets them to empty values.
  You may include a range specifier to clear a segment of the array rather
  than the whole array, e.g. "array clear \%a[22:38]"
 
ARRAY SET arrayname value
  Sets all elements of the array to the given value.  You may specify a
  range to set a segment of the array, e.g. "array set \%a[2:9] 0"
 
ARRAY RESIZE arrayname number
  Changes the size of the given array, which must already exist, to the
  number given.  If the number is smaller than the current size, the extra
  elements are discarded; if it is larger, new empty elements are added.
 
ARRAY COPY array1 array2
  Copies array1 to array2.  If array2 has not been declared, it is created
  automatically.  If it array2 does exist, array1 is copied INTO it, as
  much as will fit.  Range specifiers may be given on one or both arrays.
 
ARRAY LINK array1 arra2
  Makes array1 a link to array2.
 
[ ARRAY ] SORT [ switches ] array-name [ array2 ]
  Sorts the given array lexically according to the switches.  Element 0 of
  the array is excluded from sorting by default.  The ARRAY keyword is
  optional.  If a second array name is given, that array is sorted according
  to the first one.  Switches:
 
  /CASE:{ON,OFF}
    If ON, alphabetic case matters; if OFF it is ignored.  If this switch is
    omitted, the current SET CASE setting applies.
 
  /KEY:number
    Position (1-based column number) at which comparisons begin, 1 by default.
 
  /NUMERIC
    Specifies a numeric rather than lexical sort.
 
  /RANGE:low[:high]
    The range of elements, low through high, to be sorted.  If this switch
    is not given, elements 1 through the dimensioned size are sorted.  If
    :high is omitted, the dimensioned size is used.  To include element 0 in
    a sort, use /RANGE:0 (to sort the whole array) or /RANGE:0:n (to sort
    elements 0 through n).  You can use a range specifier in the array name
    instead of the /RANGE switch.
 
  /REVERSE
    Sort in reverse order.  If this switch is not given, the array is sorted
    in ascending order.
 
Various functions are available for array operations; see HELP FUNCTION for
details.  These include \fdimension(), \farraylook(), \ffiles(), \fsplit(),
and many more.
```

### ASCII

Synonym: TEXT

```
Inhibits automatic transfer-mode switching and forces TEXT (ASCII) transfer
mode for all files in both Kermit and FTP protocols.
```

### ASG

Synonym for [ASSIGN](#assign).

### ASK

```
Syntax:  ASK [ switches ] variablename [ prompt ]
Example: ASK \%n { What is your name\? }
  Issues the prompt and defines the variable to be whatever is typed in
  response, up to the terminating carriage return.  Use braces to preserve
  leading and/or trailing spaces in the prompt.
 
Syntax:  ASKQ [ switches ] variablename [ prompt ]
Example: ASKQ \%p { Password:}
  Like ASK except the response does not echo on the screen or, if specified
  it echoes as asterisks or other specified character.
 
Switches:
 /DEFAULT:text
  Text to supply if the user enters a blank response or the /TIMEOUT
  limit expired with no response.
 
 /ECHO:char
  (ASKQ only) Character to be echoed each time the user presses a key
  corresponding to a printable character.  This lets users see what they are
  doing when they are typing (e.g.) passwords, and makes editing easier.
 
 /TIMEOUT:number
  If the response is not entered within the given number of seconds, the
  command fails.  This is equivalent to setting ASK-TIMER to a positive
  number, except it applies only to this command.  Also see SET ASK-TIMER.
  NOTE: If a /DEFAULT: value was also given, it is supplied automatically
  upon timeout and the command does NOT fail.
 
 /QUIET
  Suppresses "?Timed out" message when /TIMEOUT is given and user doesn't
  respond within the time limit.
```

### ASKQ

```
Syntax:  ASK [ switches ] variablename [ prompt ]
Example: ASK \%n { What is your name\? }
  Issues the prompt and defines the variable to be whatever is typed in
  response, up to the terminating carriage return.  Use braces to preserve
  leading and/or trailing spaces in the prompt.
 
Syntax:  ASKQ [ switches ] variablename [ prompt ]
Example: ASKQ \%p { Password:}
  Like ASK except the response does not echo on the screen or, if specified
  it echoes as asterisks or other specified character.
 
Switches:
 /DEFAULT:text
  Text to supply if the user enters a blank response or the /TIMEOUT
  limit expired with no response.
 
 /ECHO:char
  (ASKQ only) Character to be echoed each time the user presses a key
  corresponding to a printable character.  This lets users see what they are
  doing when they are typing (e.g.) passwords, and makes editing easier.
 
 /TIMEOUT:number
  If the response is not entered within the given number of seconds, the
  command fails.  This is equivalent to setting ASK-TIMER to a positive
  number, except it applies only to this command.  Also see SET ASK-TIMER.
  NOTE: If a /DEFAULT: value was also given, it is supplied automatically
  upon timeout and the command does NOT fail.
 
 /QUIET
  Suppresses "?Timed out" message when /TIMEOUT is given and user doesn't
  respond within the time limit.
```

### ASS

Synonym for [ASSIGN](#assign).

### ASSERT

```
Syntax: ASSERT <condition>
Succeeds or fails depending on <condition>; see HELP IF for <condition>s.
```

### ASSIGN

Synonyms: ASG, ASS

```
Syntax:  ASSIGN variablename string.
Example: ASSIGN \%a My name is \%b.
  Assigns the current value of the string to the variable (or macro).
  The definition string is fully evaluated before it is assigned, so that
  the values of any variables that are contained are used, rather than their
  names.  Compare with DEFINE.  To illustrate the difference, try this:
 
    DEFINE \%a hello
    DEFINE \%x \%a
    ASSIGN \%y \%a
    DEFINE \%a goodbye
    ECHO \%x \%y
 
  This prints 'goodbye hello'.
```

### ASSOCIATE

```
ASSOCIATE FILE-CHARACTER-SET <file-character-set> <transfer-character-set>
  Tells C-Kermit that whenever the given file-character set is selected, and
  SEND CHARACTER-SET (q.v.) is AUTOMATIC, the given transfer character-set
  is selected automatically.
 
ASSOCIATE XFER-CHARACTER-SET <xfer-character-set> <file-character-set>
  Tells C-Kermit that whenever the given transfer-character set is selected,
  either by command or by an announcer attached to an incoming text file,
  and SEND CHARACTER-SET is AUTOMATIC, the specified file character-set is
  to be selected automatically.  Synonym: ASSOCIATE TRANSFER-CHARACTER-SET.
 
Use SHOW ASSOCIATIONS to list the current character-set associations, and
SHOW CHARACTER-SETS to list the current settings.
```

### BACK

```
Syntax: BACK
  Returns to your previous directory.
```

### BEEP

```
Syntax: BEEP
Sends a BEL character to your terminal.
```

### BINARY

```
Inhibits automatic transfer-mode switching and forces BINARY transfer mode
for all files in both Kermit and FTP protocols.
```

### BROWSE

```
Syntax: BROWSE [ <url> ]
Starts your preferred Web browser on the given URL, or if none given, the
most recently visited URL, if any.  Also see SET BROWSER.
```

### BUG

Synonym for [SUPPORT](#support).

### BYE

```
Syntax: BYE
  Shut down and log out a remote Kermit server
```

### C

Synonym for [CONNECT](#connect).

### CAT

```
Syntax: MORE [ switches ] filename
  Equivalent to TYPE /NOPAGE filename; see HELP TYPE.
```

### CAUTIOUS

```
FAST, CAUTIOUS, and ROBUST are predefined macros that set several
file-transfer parameters at once to achieve the desired file-transfer goal.
FAST chooses a large packet size, a large window size, and a fair amount of
control-character unprefixing at the risk of possible failure on some
connections.  FAST is the default tuning in C-Kermit 7.0 and later.  In case
FAST file transfers fail for you on a particular connection, try CAUTIOUS.
If that fails too, try ROBUST.  You can also change the definitions of each
macro with the DEFINE command.  To see the current definitions, type
"show macro fast", "show macro cautious", or "show macro robust".
```

### CD

Synonym: CWD

```
  If LOCUS is REMOTE or LOCUS is AUTO and you have an FTP connection,
  this command is equivalent to REMOTE CD (RCD).  Otherwise:
 
Syntax: CD [ directory name ]
  Change Directory.  Changes your current, working, default directory to the
  one given, so that future non-absolute filename references are relative to
  this directory.  If the directory name is omitted, your home (login)
  directory is supplied.
  C-Kermit's default prompt shows your current directory.
  Synonyms: LCD, CWD.
  Also see: SET LOCUS, PWD, CDUP, BACK, REMOTE CD (RCD), SET CD, SET PROMPT.
  And see: HELP KCD.
  Relevant environment variables: CDPATH, HOME.
```

### CDUP

```
Change working directory to the one just above the current one.
```

### CGET

```
Syntax: CGET <remote-file-or-command> <local-command>
Equivalent to GET /COMMAND; see HELP GET for details.
```

### CH

Synonym for [CHECK](#check).

### CHANGE

```
Syntax: CHANGE [ switches ] filespec string1 string2
  Changes all occurrences of string1 to string2 in the given file or files.
  Works line by line, does not do multiline or across-line substitutions.
  To remove strings from files, specify string2 as "" or omit string2.
  Temporary files are created in the directory indicated by \v(tmpdir)
  (show var tmpdir).  You can select a different temporary directory with
  the SET TEMP-DIRECTORY command.  All temporary files are deleted after use.
 
  String1 and String2 should be enclosed in doublequotes "" or braces {} if
  if they contain spaces.  In the event that they already contain braces or
  doublequotes, especially if these are not balanced, some quoting may be
  required.  Or you can assign the strings to variables and then use the
  variable names in the CHANGE command; example:
 
    .a = {value="./
    .b = {value="../
    change *.html \m(a) \m(b)
 
  Since the CHANGE command works line by line, only text files can be
  changed; C-Kermit automatically skips over binary files.
 
  File selection switches (factory defaults are marked with +):
 
   /AFTER:         Select files modified after the given date
   /BEFORE:        Select files modified before the given date
   /LARGER:        Select files larger than the given size in bytes
   /SMALLER:       Select files smaller than the given size in bytes
   /EXCEPT:        Exclude the given files (list or pattern)
   /DOTFILES       Include files whose names start with dot (period).
   /NODOTFILES   + Don't include files whose names start with dot.
   /RECURSIVE      Descend through subdirectories.
   /NORECURSIVE  + Don't descend through subdirectories.
 
 File disposition switches:
 
   /BACKUP:name       Back up original files to named directory.
   /DESTINATION:name  Store resulting changed files in named directory.
   If neither of these options is given, original files are overwritten.
 
 String selection switches:
 
   /CASE:{ON,OFF}  OFF (default) = ignore case in string1; ON = don't ignore
 
 Action switches:
 
   /COUNT:name     Set named variable to number of files that were changed.
   /SIMULATE       List files that would be changed, but don't change them.
   /LIST           Show which files are being changed.
   /MODTIME:       Modification time for change files, PRESERVE or UPDATE.
 
You can use the /SIMULATE switch in combination with other switches to see
which files will be affected without actually changing them.
```

### CHECK

Synonym: CH

```
Syntax: CHECK name
  Checks  to see if the named feature is included in this version of Kermit.
  To list the features you can check, type "check ?".
```

### CHMOD

```
Syntax: CHMOD [ switches ] code filespec
  UNIX only.  Changes permissions of the given file(s) to the given code,
  which must be an octal number such as 664 or 775.  Optional switches:
 
   /FILES        Only change permissions of regular files.
   /DIRECTORIES  Only change permissions of directory files.
   /TYPE:BINARY  Only change permissions of binary files.
   /TYPE:TEXT    Only change permissions of text files.
   /DOTFILES     Include files whose names begin with dot (.).
   /RECURSIVE    Change permissions in subdirectories too.
   /LIST         List each file (synonym: /VERBOSE).
   /NOLIST       Operate silently (synonym: /QUIET).
   /PAGE         When listing, pause at end of each screen (implies /LIST).
   /NOPAGE       When listing, don't pause at end of each screen.
   /SIMULATE     Show what would be done but don't actually do it.
```

### CHROOT

```
Syntax: SET ROOT directoryname
  Sets the root for file access to the given directory and disables access
  to system and shell commands and external programs.  Once this command
  is given, no files or directories outside the tree rooted by the given
  directory can be opened, read, listed, deleted, renamed, or accessed in
  any other way.  This command can not be undone by a subsequent SET ROOT
  command.  Primarily for use with server mode, to restrict access of
  clients to a particular directory tree.  Synonym: CHROOT.
```

### CKERMIT

Example: COMMENT - this is a comment.
  Introduces a comment.  Beginning of command line only.  Commands may also
  have trailing comments, introduced by ; or #.
```

### COMPACT-SUBSTRING

```
Compact Substring Notation is a shorthand notation for the built-in
\fsubstring() function; 'name' is the name of any macro-type variable:
  \s(name[n:m])
      Substring of \m(name) starting at position n, length m
  \s(name[n_m])
      Substring of \m(name) from position n to position m
  \s(name[n]) or \s(name[n:])
      Substring of \m(name) from position n to the end
  \s(name[n.])
      The character at position n
```

### CONNECT

Synonym: C

```
Syntax: CONNECT (or C, or CQ) [ switches ]
  Connect to a remote computer via the serial communications device given in
  the most recent SET LINE command, or to the network host named in the most
  recent SET HOST command.  Type the escape character followed by C to get
  back to the C-Kermit prompt, or followed by ? for a list of CONNECT-mode
  escape commands.
 
Include the /QUIETLY switch to suppress the informational message that
tells you how to escape back, etc.  CQ is a synonym for CONNECT /QUIETLY.
 
Other switches include:
 
/TRIGGER:string
  One or more strings to look for that will cause automatic return to
  command mode.  To specify one string, just put it right after the
  colon, e.g. "/TRIGGER:Goodbye".  If the string contains any spaces, you
  must enclose it in braces, e.g. "/TRIGGER:{READY TO SEND...}".  To
  specify more than one trigger, use the following format:
 
    /TRIGGER:{{string1}{string2}...{stringn}}
 
  Upon return from CONNECT mode, the variable \v(trigger) is set to the
  trigger string, if any, that was actually encountered.  This value, like
  all other CONNECT switches applies only to the CONNECT command with which
  it is given, and overrides (temporarily) any global SET TERMINAL TRIGGER
  string that might be in effect.

Your escape character is Ctrl-\ (ASCII 28, FS)
```

### CONTINUE

```
 In a FOR or WHILE loop: continue the loop.
 At the prompt: continue a script that has "shelled out" to the prompt.
```

### CONVERT

Synonyms: TRANSLATE, XLATE

```
Syntax: CONVERT file1 cs1 cs2 [ file2 ]
Synonym: TRANSLATE
  Converts file1 from the character set cs1 into the character set cs2
  and stores the result in file2.  The character sets can be any of
  C-Kermit's file character sets.  If file2 is omitted, the translation
  is displayed on the screen.  An appropriate intermediate character-set
  is chosen automatically, if necessary.  Synonym: XLATE.  Example:
 
    CONVERT lasagna.txt latin1 utf8 lasagna-utf8.txt
 
  Multiple files can be translated if file2 is a directory or device name,
  rather than a filename, or if file2 is omitted.
```

### COP

Synonym for [COPY](#copy).

### COPY

Synonyms: CO, COP, CP

```
Syntax: COPY [ switches ] file1 file2
  Copies the source file (file1) to the destination file (file2).  If file2
  is a directory, file1 can contain wildcards to denote a group of files to
  be copied to the given directory.  Switches:
 
  /TOSCREEN
    Displays the file on the screen rather than copying to another file.
 
  /LIST
    Print the filenames and status while copying.  Synonyms: /LOG, /VERBOSE.
 
  /NOLIST
    Copy silently (default). Synonyms: /NOLOG, /QUIET.
 
  /PRESERVE
    Copy timestamp and permissions from source file to destination file.
 
  /OVERWRITE:{ALWAYS,NEVER,NEWER,OLDER}
    When copying from one directory to another, this tells what to do when
    the destination file already exists: overwrite it always; never; only if
    the source file is newer; or only if the source file is older.
 
  /APPEND
    Append the source file to the destination file.  In this case the source
    file specification can contain wildcards, and all the matching source
    files are appended, one after the other in alphabetical order by name,
    to the destination file.
 
  /SWAP-BYTES
    Swap bytes while copying (e.g. for converting between Big-Endian and
    Little-Endian binary data formats).
 
  /FROMB64
    Convert from Base64 encoding while copying.
 
  /TOB64
    Convert to Base64 encoding while copying.
 
  /INTERPRET
    If the file contains Kermit backslash escapes like \v(date), \v(time),
    \%1, \%2, \m(fast), etc, they are interpreted in the new copy of the
    file or in the screen version, if used in combination with /TOSCREEN.
    This option is not compatible most of the other options.

### CRECEIVE

```
Syntax: CRECEIVE [ switches ] <command>
Receives to the given <command> rather than to a file.  Equivalent to
RECEIVE /COMMAND; see HELP RECEIVE for details.

Synonym for [CD](#cd).

### DATE

```
Syntax: DATE [ date-time [ timezone ] ] [ delta-time ]
  Prints a date-time in standard format: yyyymmdd_hh:mm:ss.
  Various date-time formats are accepted:
 
  . The date, if given, must precede the time.
  . The year must be four digits or else a 2-digit format dd mmm yy,
    in which case if (yy < 50) yyyy = yy + 2000; else yyyy = yy + 1900.
  . If the year comes first, the second field is the month.
  . The day, month, and year may be separated by spaces, /, -, or underscore.
  . The date and time may be separated by spaces or underscore.
  . The month may be numeric (1 = January) or spelled out or abbreviated in
    English.
  . The time may be in 24-hour format or 12-hour format.
  . If the hour is 12 or less, AM is assumed unless AM or PM is included.
  . If the date is omitted but a time is given, the current date is supplied.
  . If the time is given but date omitted, 00:00:00 is supplied.
  . If both the date and time are omitted, the current date and time are
    supplied.
 
  The following shortcuts can also be used in place of dates:
 
  NOW
    Stands for the current date and time.
 
  TODAY
    Today's date, optionally followed by a time; 00:00:00 if no time given.
 
  YESTERDAY
    Yesterday's date, optionally followed by a time (default 00:00:00).
 
  TOMORROW
    Tomorrows's date, optionally followed by a time (default 00:00:00).
 
  Timezone specifications are similar to those used in e-mail and HTTP
    headers, either a USA timezone name, e.g. EST, or a signed four-digit
    timezone offset, {+,-}hhmm, e.g., -0500; it is used to convert date-time,
    a local time in that timezone, to GMT which is then converted to the
    local time at the host.  If no timezone is given, the date-time is local.
    To convert local time (or a time in a specified timezone) to UTC (GMT),
    use the function \futcdate().
 
  Delta times are given as {+,-}[number date-units][hh[:mm[:ss]]]
    A date in the future/past relative to the date-time; date-units may be
    DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS, YEARS: +3days, -7weeks, +3:00, +1month 8:00.
 
All the formats shown above are acceptable as arguments to date-time switches
such as /AFTER: or /BEFORE:, and to functions such as \fcvtdate(),
\fdiffdate(), and \futcdate(), that take date-time strings as arguments.
```

### DCL

Synonym: DECLARE

```
Syntax: ARRAY verb operands...
 
Declares arrays and performs various operations on them.  Arrays have
the following syntax:
 
  \&a[n]
 
where "a" is a letter and n is a number or a variable with a numeric value
or an arithmetic expression.  The value of an array element can be anything
at all -- a number, a character, a string, a filename, etc.
 
The following ARRAY verbs are available:
 
[ ARRAY ] DECLARE arrayname[n] [ = initializers... ]
  Declares an array of the given size, n.  The resulting array has n+1
  elements, 0 through n.  Array elements can be used just like any other
  variables.  Initial values can be given for elements 1, 2, ... by
  including = followed by one or more values separated by spaces.  If you
  omit the size, the array is sized according to the number of initializers;
  if none are given the array is destroyed and undeclared if it already
  existed.  The ARRAY keyword is optional.  Synonym: [ ARRAY ] DCL.
 
[ ARRAY ] UNDECLARE arrayname
  Destroys and undeclares the given array.  Synonym: ARRAY DESTROY.
 
ARRAY SHOW [ arrayname ]
  Displays the contents of the given array.  A range specifier can be
  included to display a segment of the array, e.g. "array show \&a[1:24]."
  If the arrayname is omitted, all declared arrays are listed, but their
  contents is not shown.  Synonym: SHOW ARRAY.
 
ARRAY CLEAR arrayname
  Clears all elements of the array, i.e. sets them to empty values.
  You may include a range specifier to clear a segment of the array rather
  than the whole array, e.g. "array clear \%a[22:38]"
 
ARRAY SET arrayname value
  Sets all elements of the array to the given value.  You may specify a
  range to set a segment of the array, e.g. "array set \%a[2:9] 0"
 
ARRAY RESIZE arrayname number
  Changes the size of the given array, which must already exist, to the
  number given.  If the number is smaller than the current size, the extra
  elements are discarded; if it is larger, new empty elements are added.
 
ARRAY COPY array1 array2
  Copies array1 to array2.  If array2 has not been declared, it is created
  automatically.  If it array2 does exist, array1 is copied INTO it, as
  much as will fit.  Range specifiers may be given on one or both arrays.
 
ARRAY LINK array1 arra2
  Makes array1 a link to array2.
 
[ ARRAY ] SORT [ switches ] array-name [ array2 ]
  Sorts the given array lexically according to the switches.  Element 0 of
  the array is excluded from sorting by default.  The ARRAY keyword is
  optional.  If a second array name is given, that array is sorted according
  to the first one.  Switches:
 
  /CASE:{ON,OFF}
    If ON, alphabetic case matters; if OFF it is ignored.  If this switch is
    omitted, the current SET CASE setting applies.
 
  /KEY:number
    Position (1-based column number) at which comparisons begin, 1 by default.
 
  /NUMERIC
    Specifies a numeric rather than lexical sort.
 
  /RANGE:low[:high]
    The range of elements, low through high, to be sorted.  If this switch
    is not given, elements 1 through the dimensioned size are sorted.  If
    :high is omitted, the dimensioned size is used.  To include element 0 in
    a sort, use /RANGE:0 (to sort the whole array) or /RANGE:0:n (to sort
    elements 0 through n).  You can use a range specifier in the array name
    instead of the /RANGE switch.
 
  /REVERSE
    Sort in reverse order.  If this switch is not given, the array is sorted
    in ascending order.
 
Various functions are available for array operations; see HELP FUNCTION for
details.  These include \fdimension(), \farraylook(), \ffiles(), \fsplit(),
and many more.
```

### DECLARE

Synonym for [DCL](#dcl).

### DECREMENT

```
Syntax: DECREMENT variablename [ amount ]
  Decrement (subtract one from) the value of a variable if the current value
  is numeric.  If an optional amount is specified (as a number, a variable,
  or an arithmetic expression that evaluates to a number, or any combination)
  the variable is decremented by that number instead of 1.  The result is
  always an integer.  If floating-point numbers are given, the result is
  truncated.
 
Examples: DECR \%a, DECR days 7, DECR x \%n, DECR sum \%x+12
```

### DEFINE

Synonym: .

```
Syntax: DEFINE name [ definition ]
  Defines a macro or variable.  Its value is the definition, taken
  literally.  No expansion or evaluation of the definition is done.  Thus
  if the definition includes any variable or function references, their
  names are included, rather than their values (compare with ASSIGN).  If
  the definition is omitted, then the named variable or macro is undefined.
  If a variable of the same name already exists, its value is replaced by
  the new value.
 
A typical macro definition looks like this:
 
  DEFINE name command, command, command, ...
 
for example:
 
  DEFINE vax set parity even, set duplex full, set flow xon/xoff
 
which defines a Kermit command macro called 'vax'.  The definition is a
comma-separated list of Kermit commands.  Use the DO command to execute
the macro, or just type its name, followed optionally by arguments.
 
The definition of a variable can be anything at all, for example:
 
  DEFINE \%a Monday
  DEFINE \%b 3
 
These variables can be used almost anywhere, for example:
 
  ECHO Today is \%a
  SET BLOCK-CHECK \%b
```

### DELETE

Synonyms: ERASE, RM

```
Syntax: DELETE [ switches... ] filespec
  If LOCUS is REMOTE or LOCUS is AUTO and you have an FTP connection,
  this command is equivalent to REMOTE DELETE (RDELETE).  Otherwise:
 
  Deletes a file or files on the computer where C-Kermit is running.
  The filespec may denote a single file or can include wildcard characters
  to match multiple files.  RM is a synonym for DELETE.  Switches include:
 
/AFTER:date-time
  Specifies that only those files modified after the given date-time are
  to be deleted.  HELP DATE for info about date-time formats.
 
/BEFORE:date-time
  Specifies that only those files modified before the given date-time
  are to be deleted.
 
/NOT-AFTER:date-time
  Specifies that only those files modified at or before the given date-time
  are to be deleted.
 
/NOT-BEFORE:date-time
  Specifies that only those files modified at or after the given date-time
  are to be deleted.
 
/LARGER-THAN:number
  Specifies that only those files longer than the given number of bytes are
  to be deleted.
 
/SMALLER-THAN:number
  Specifies that only those files smaller than the given number of bytes are
  to be sent.
 
/EXCEPT:pattern
  Specifies that any files whose names match the pattern, which can be a
  regular filename or may contain wildcards, are not to be deleted.  To
  specify multiple patterns (up to 8), use outer braces around the group
  and inner braces around each pattern:
 
    /EXCEPT:{{pattern1}{pattern2}...}
 
/DOTFILES
  Include (delete) files whose names begin with ".".
 
/NODOTFILES
  Skip (don't delete) files whose names begin with ".".
 
/TYPE:TEXT
  Delete only regular text files (requires FILE SCAN ON as it is by default)
 
/TYPE:BINARY
  Delete only regular binary files (requires FILE SCAN ON)
 
/DIRECTORIES
  Include directories.  If this switch is not given, only regular files
  are deleted.  If it is given, Kermit attempts to delete any directories
  that match the given file specification, which succeeds only if the
  directory is empty.
 
/RECURSIVE
  The DELETE command applies to the entire directory tree rooted in the
  current or specified directory.  When the /DIRECTORIES switch is also
  given, Kermit deletes all the (matching) files in each directory before
  attempting to delete the directory itself.
 
/ALL
  This is a shortcut for /RECURSIVE /DIRECTORIES /DOTFILES.
 
/LIST
  List each file and tell whether it was deleted.  Synonyms: /LOG, /VERBOSE.
 
/NOLIST
  Don't list files while deleting.  Synonyms: /NOLOG, /QUIET.
 
/HEADING
  Print heading and summary information.
 
/NOHEADING
  Don't print heading and summary information.
 
/SUMMARY
  Like /HEADING /NOLIST, but only prints the summary line.
 
/PAGE
  If listing, pause after each screenful.
 
/NOPAGE
  Don't pause after each screenful.
 
/ASK
  Interactively ask permission to delete each file.  Reply Yes or OK to
  delete it, No not to delete it, Quit to cancel the DELETE command, and
  Go to go ahead and delete all the rest of the files without asking.
 
/NOASK
  Delete files without asking permission.
 
/SIMULATE
  Preview files selected for deletion without actually deleting them.
  Implies /LIST.
 
Use SET OPTIONS DELETE to make selected switches effective for every DELETE
command unless you override them; use SHOW OPTIONS to see selections currently
in effect.  Also see HELP SET LOCUS, HELP PURGE, HELP WILDCARD.
```

### DIAL

```
Syntax:  DIAL phonenumber
Example: DIAL 7654321
  Dials a number using an autodial modem.  First you must SET MODEM TYPE, then
  SET LINE, then SET SPEED.  Then give the DIAL command, including the phone
  number, for example:
 
   DIAL 7654321
 
  If the modem is on a network modem server, SET HOST first, then SET MODEM
  TYPE, then DIAL.
 
If you give the DIAL command interactively at the Kermit prompt, and the
call is placed successfully, Kermit automatically enters CONNECT mode.
If the DIAL command is given from a macro or command file, Kermit remains
in command mode after the call is placed, successfully or not.  You can
change this behavior with the SET DIAL CONNECT command.
 
If the phonenumber starts with a letter, and if you have used the SET DIAL
DIRECTORY command to specify one or more dialing-directory files, Kermit
looks it up in the given file(s); if it is found, the name is replaced by
the number or numbers associated with the name.  If it is not found, the
name is sent to the modem literally.
 
If the phonenumber starts with an equals sign ("="), this forces the part
after the = to be sent literally to the modem, even if it starts with a
letter, without any directory lookup.
 
You can also give a list of phone numbers enclosed in braces, e.g:
 
  dial {{7654321}{8765432}{+1 (212 555-1212}}
 
(Each number is enclosed in braces and the entire list is also enclosed in
braces.)  In this case, each number is tried until there is an answer.  The
phone numbers in this kind of list can not be names of dialing directory
entries.
 
A dialing directory is a plain text file, one entry per line:
 
  name  phonenumber  ;  comments
 
for example:
 
  work    9876543              ; This is a comment
  e-mail  +1  (212) 555 4321   ; My electronic mailbox
  germany +49 (511) 555 1234   ; Our branch in Hanover
 
If a phone number starts with +, then it must include country code and
area code, and C-Kermit will try to handle these appropriately based on
the current locale (HELP SET DIAL for further info); these are called
PORTABLE entries.  If it does not start with +, it is dialed literally.
 
If more than one entry is found with the same name, Kermit dials all of
them until the call is completed; if the entries are in portable format,
Kermit dials them in cheap-to-expensive order: internal, then local, then
long-distance, then international, based on its knowledge of your local
country code and area code (see HELP SET DIAL).
 
Specify your dialing directory file(s) with the SET DIAL DIRECTORY command.
 
See also SET DIAL, SET MODEM, SET LINE, SET HOST, SET SPEED, REDIAL, and
PDIAL.
```

### DIRECTORY

Synonyms: FOT, LS, V, VDIRECTORY

```
Syntax: DIRECTORY [ switches ] [ filespec [ filespec [ ... ] ] ]
  If LOCUS is REMOTE or LOCUS is AUTO and you have an FTP connection,
  this command is equivalent to REMOTE DIRECTORY (RDIR).  Otherwise:
 
  Lists local files.  The filespec may be a filename, possibly containing
  wildcard characters, or a directory name.  If no filespec is given, all
  files in the current directory are listed.  If a directory name is given,
  all the  files in it are listed.  Multiple filespecs can be given.
  Optional switches:
 
   /BRIEF           List filenames only.
   /VERBOSE       + Also list permissions, size, and date.
   /FILES           Show files but not directories.
   /DIRECTORIES     Show directories but not files.
   /ALL           + Show both files and directories.
   /ARRAY:&a        Store file list in specified array (e.g. \%a[]).
   /PAGE            Pause after each screenful.
   /NOPAGE          Don't pause after each screenful.
   /TOP:n           Only show the top n lines of the directory listing.
   /DOTFILES        Include files whose names start with dot (period).
   /NODOTFILES    + Don't include files whose names start with dot.
   /FOLLOWLINKS     Follow symbolic links.
   /NOFOLLOWLINKS + Don't follow symbolic links.
   /NOLINKS         Don't list symbolic links at all.
   /BACKUP        + Include backup files (names end with .~n~).
   /NOBACKUPFILES   Don't include backup files.
   /OUTPUT:file     Store directory listing in the given file.
   /HEADING         Include heading and summary.
   /NOHEADING     + Don't include heading or summary.
   /COUNT:var       Put the number of matching files in the given variable.
   /SUMMARY         Print only count and total size of matching files.
   /XFERMODE        Show pattern-based transfer mode (T=Text, B=Binary).
   /TYPE:           Show only files of the specified type (text or binary).
   /MESSAGE:text    Add brief message to each listing line.
   /NOMESSAGE     + Don't add message to each listing line.
   /NOXFERMODE    + Don't show pattern-based transfer mode
   /ISODATE       + In verbose listings, show date in ISO 8061 format.
   /ENGLISHDATE     In verbose listings, show date in "English" format.
   /RECURSIVE       Descend through subdirectories.
   /NORECURSIVE   + Don't descend through subdirectories.
   /SORT:key        Sort by key, NAME, DATE, or SIZE; default key is NAME.
   /NOSORT        + Don't sort.
   /ASCENDING     + If sorting, sort in ascending order.
   /REVERSE         If sorting, sort in reverse order.
 
Factory defaults are marked with +.  Default for paging depends on SET
COMMAND MORE-PROMPTING.  Use SET OPTIONS DIRECTORY [ switches ] to change
defaults; use SHOW OPTIONS to display customized defaults.  Also see
WDIRECTORY.
```

### DISABLE

```
Syntax: DISABLE command [ { LOCAL, REMOTE, BOTH } ]
  Prevents execution of the named command.  The optional parameter
  specifies the mode in which the command is disabled:

  LOCAL:  Disabled in local mode, which applies to commands requested
          by a remote host via escape sequences or APC.
  REMOTE: Disabled in remote mode, which applies to commands received
          by a Kermit server.
  BOTH:   Disabled in both modes.

  If the parameter is omitted, BOTH is used.  By default, most commands
  are enabled for REMOTE but disabled for LOCAL to prevent security issues.
  Use SHOW SERVER to view the current enable/disable states, along
  with which of LOCAL or REMOTE actually governs this connection.
```

### DO

```
Syntax: [ DO ] macroname [ arguments ]
  Executes a macro that was defined with the DEFINE command.  The word DO
  can be omitted.  Trailing argument words, if any, are automatically
  assigned to the macro argument variables \%1 through \%9.
```

### E

  Allows execution of the named capability.  The optional parameter
  specifies the mode in which the capability is enabled:

  LOCAL:  Enabled in local mode, which applies to commands requested
          by a remote host via escape sequences or APC.
  REMOTE: Enabled in remote mode, which applies to commands received
          by a Kermit server.
  BOTH:   Enabled in both modes.

  If the parameter is omitted, BOTH is used.  By default, most commands
  are enabled for REMOTE but disabled for LOCAL to prevent security issues.
  Use SHOW SERVER to view the current enable/disable states, along
  with which of LOCAL or REMOTE actually governs this connection.
```

### END

  The expression can contain numbers and/or numeric-valued variables or
  functions, combined with mathematical operators and parentheses in
  traditional notation.  Operators include +-/*(), etc.  Example:
  EVALUATE \%n (1+1) * (\%a / 3).
 
  NOTE: Prior to C-Kermit 7.0, the syntax was "EVALUATE expression"
  (no variable), and the result was printed.  Use SET EVAL { OLD, NEW }
  to choose the old or new behavior, which is NEW by default.
 
Alse see: HELP FUNCTION EVAL.
```

### EX

Synonym for [EXIT](#exit).

### EXEC

```
Syntax: EXEC <command> [ <arg1> [ <arg2> [ ... ] ]
  C-Kermit overlays itself with the given system command and starts it with
  the given arguments.  Upon any error, control returns to C-Kermit.
```

### EXIT

Synonyms: E, EX

```
Syntax: EXIT (or QUIT) [ number [ text ] ]
  Exits from the Kermit program, closing all open files and devices.
  If a number is given it becomes Kermit's exit status code.  If text is
  included, it is printed.  Also see SET EXIT.
```

### EXTPROC

Synonym for [COMMENT](#comment).

### F

Synonym for [FINISH](#finish).

### FAIL

```
Always fails.
```

### FAST

```
FAST, CAUTIOUS, and ROBUST are predefined macros that set several
file-transfer parameters at once to achieve the desired file-transfer goal.
FAST chooses a large packet size, a large window size, and a fair amount of
control-character unprefixing at the risk of possible failure on some
connections.  FAST is the default tuning in C-Kermit 7.0 and later.  In case
FAST file transfers fail for you on a particular connection, try CAUTIOUS.
If that fails too, try ROBUST.  You can also change the definitions of each
macro with the DEFINE command.  To see the current definitions, type
"show macro fast", "show macro cautious", or "show macro robust".
```

### FCLOSE

```
Syntax: FILE CLOSE <channel>
  Closes the file on the given channel if it was open.
  Also see HELP FILE OPEN.  Synonym: FCLOSE.
```

### FCOUNT

```
Syntax: FILE COUNT [ { /BYTES, /LINES, /LIST, /NOLIST } ] <channel>
  If the channel is open, this command prints the nubmer of bytes (default)
  or lines in the file if at top level or if /LIST is included; if /NOLIST
  is given, the result is not printed.  In all cases the result is assigned
  to \v(f_count).  Synonym: FCOUNT
```

### FFLUSH

```
Syntax: FILE FLUSH <channel>
  Flushes output buffers on the given channel if it was open, forcing
  all material previously written to be committed to disk.  Synonym: FFLUSH.
  Also available as \F_flush().
```

### FI

Synonym for [FINISH](#finish).

### FILE

```
Syntax: FILE <subcommand> [ switches ] <channel> [ <data> ]

```

### FIN

Synonym for [FINISH](#finish).

### FIND

Synonyms: GREP, SEARCH

```
Syntax: GREP [ options ] pattern filespec
  Searches through the given file or files for the given character string
  or pattern.  In the normal case, all lines containing any text that matches
  the pattern are printed.  Pattern syntax is as described in HELP PATTERNS
  except that '*' is implied at the beginning unless the pattern starts with
  '^' and also at the end unless the pattern ends with '$'.  Therefore,
  "grep something *.txt" lists all lines in all *.txt files that contain
  the word "something", but "grep ^something *.txt" lists only the lines
  that START with "something".  The command succeeds if any of the given
  files contains any lines that match the pattern, otherwise it fails.
  Synonym: FIND.
 
Only one filespec can be given.  To search multiple files that can't
be represented by a wildcard use {file1,file2,file3,...} (in braces).
 
File selection options:
  /NOBACKUPFILES
    Excludes backup files (like oofa.txt.~3~) from the search.
  /DOTFILES
    Includes files whose names start with dot (.) in the search.
  /NODOTFILES
    Excludes files whose names start with dot (.) from the search.
  /RECURSIVE
    Searches through files in subdirectories too.
  /TYPE:TEXT
    Search only text files (requires FILE SCAN ON).
  /TYPE:BINARY
    Search only binary files (requires FILE SCAN ON).
 
Pattern-matching options:
  /NOCASE
    Ignores case of letters when comparing.  Depends on the underlying
    operating system APIs to work for non-ASCII character sets.
  /NOMATCH
    Searches for lines that do NOT match the pattern.
  /EXCEPT:pattern
    Exclude lines that match the main pattern that also match this pattern.
  /VERBATIM
    The search string is taken literally; variables are not evaluated.
    This allows you to (for example) search Kermit scripts that contain
    variable names, function names, etc (that begin with '\').
 
Display options:
  /COUNT:variable-name
    For each file, prints only the filename and a count of matching lines
    and assigns the total match count to the variable, if one is given.
  /DISPLAY:number
    How many matching lines to show.  The default is to show all matching
    lines.  Synonym:/SHOW.
  /NAMEONLY
    Prints the name of each file that contains at least one matching line,
    one name per line, rather than showing each matching line.
  /NOLIST
    Doesn't print anything (but sets SUCCESS or FAILURE appropriately).
  /LINENUMBERS
    Precedes each file line by its line number within the file.
  /PAGE
    Pauses after each screenful.
  /NOPAGE
    Doesn't pause after each screenful.
 
Result disposition options:
  /OUTPUT:name
    Sends results to the given file.
  /ARRAY:&x
    Returns the results in the specified array; one line per array element.
  /MACRO:name
    Returns the results in the macro whose name is given.  If a macro
    of the same name already exists, the grep results (if there are any)
    replace its previous value.  Synonym: DEFINE.
```

### FINISH

Synonyms: F, FI, FIN

```
Syntax: FINISH
  Tells the remote Kermit server to shut down without logging out.
```

### FIREWALL

```
Firewall Traversal in C-Kermit
 
The simplist form of firewall traversal is the HTTP CONNECT command. The
CONNECT command was implemented to allow a public web server which usually
resides on the boundary between the public and private networks to forward
HTTP requests from clients on the private network to public web sites.  To
allow secure web connections, the HTTP CONNECT command authenticates the
client with a username/password and then establishes a tunnel to the
desired host.
 
Web servers that support the CONNECT command can be configured to allow
outbound connections for authenticated users to any TCP/IP hostname-port
combination accessible to the Web server.  HTTP CONNECT can be used only
with TCP-based protocols.  Protocols such as Kerberos authentication that
use UDP/IP cannot be tunneled using HTTP CONNECT.
 
SET TCP HTTP-PROXY [switches] [<hostname or ip-address>[:<port>]]
  If a hostname or ip-address is specified, Kermit uses the given
  proxy server when attempting outgoing TCP connections.  If no hostnamer
  or ip-address is specified, any previously specified Proxy server is
  removed.  If no port number is specified, the "http" service is used.
  [switches] can be one or more of:
     /AGENT:<agent> /USER:<user> /PASSWORD:<password>
  Switch parameters are used when connecting to the proxy server and
  override any other values associated with the connection.
 
FTP is one of the few well-known Internet services that requires
multiple connections.  As described above, FTP originally required the
server to establish the data connection to the client using a destination
address and port provided by the client.  This doesn't work with port
filtering firewalls.
 
Later, FTP protocol added a "passive" mode, in which connections for
the data channels are created in the reverse direction.  Instead of the
server establishing a connection to the client, the client makes a second
connection with the server as the destination.  This works just fine as
long as the client is behind the firewall and the server is in public
address space.  If the server is behind a firewall then the traditional
active mode must be used.  If both the client and server are behind their
own port filtering firewalls then data channels cannot be established.
 
In Kermit's FTP client, passive mode is controlled with the command:
 
  SET FTP PASSIVE-MODE { ON, OFF }
 
The default is ON, meaning to use passive mode.
```

### FLIST

```
Syntax: FILE LIST
  Lists the channel number, name, modes, and position of each file opened
  with FILE OPEN.  Synonym: FLIST.
```

### FO

Synonym for [FOR](#for).

### FOPEN

```
Syntax: FILE OPEN [ switches ] <variable> <filename>
  Opens the file indicated by <filename> in the mode indicated by the
  switches, if any, or if no switches are included, in read-only mode, and
  assigns a channel number for the file to the given variable.
  Synonym: FOPEN.  Switches:
 
/READ
  Open the file for reading.
 
/STDIN
  Tells Kermit to read from Standard Input.  In this case you don't specify
  a filename.
 
/STDOUT
  Tells Kermit to write to Standard Output.  In this case you don't specify
  a filename.
 
/STDERR
  Tells Kermit to write to Standard Error.  In this case you don't specify
  a filename.
 
/WRITE
  Open the file for writing.  If /READ was not also specified, this creates
  a new file.  If /READ was specified, the existing file is preserved, but
  writing is allowed.  In both cases, the read/write pointer is initially
  at the beginning of the file.
 
/APPEND
  If the file does not exist, create a new file and open it for writing.
  If the file exists, open it for writing, but with the write pointer
  positioned at the end.
 
/BINARY
  This option is ignored in UNIX.
 
Switches can be combined in an way that makes sense and is supported by the
underlying operating system.
```

### FOR

Synonym: FO

```
Syntax: FOR variablename initial-value final-value increment { commandlist }
  FOR loop.  Execute the comma-separated commands in the commandlist the
  number of times given by the initial value, final value and increment.
  Example:  FOR \%i 10 1 -1 { pause 1, echo \%i }
```

### FORWARD

```
Like GOTO, but searches only forward for the label.  See GOTO.
```

### FOT

Synonym for [DIRECTORY](#directory).

### FREAD

```
Syntax: FILE READ [ switches ] <channel> [ <variable> ]
  Reads data from the file on the given channel number into the <variable>,
  if one was given; if no variable was given, the result is printed on
  the screen.  The variable should be a macro name rather than a \%x
  variable or array element if you want backslash characters in the file to
  be taken literally.  Synonym: FREAD.  Switches:
 
/LINE
  Specifies that a line of text is to be read.  A line is defined according
  to the underlying operating system's text-file format.  For example, in
  UNIX a line is a sequence of characters up to and including a linefeed.
  The line terminator (if any) is removed before assigning the text to the
  variable.  If no switches are included with the FILE READ command, /LINE
  is assumed.
 
/SIZE:number
  Specifies that the given number of bytes (characters) is to be read.
  This gives a semblance of "record i/o" for files that do not necessarily
  contain lines.  The resulting block of characters is assigned to the
  variable without any editing.
 
/CHARACTER
  Equivalent to /SIZE:1.  If FILE READ /CHAR succeeds but the <variable> is
  empty, this indicates a NUL byte was read.
 
/TRIM
  Trims trailing whitespace from the right when used with /LINE.  Ignored
  if used with /CHAR or /SIZE.
 
/UNTABIFY
  Tells Kermit to convert tabs to spaces (assuming tabs set every 8 spaces)
  when used with /LINE.  Ignored if used with /CHAR or /SIZE.
 
Synonym: FREAD.
Also available as \F_getchar(), \F_getline(), \F_getblock().
```

### FREWIND

```
Syntax: FILE REWIND <channel>
  If the channel is open, moves the read/write pointer to the beginning of
  the file.  Equivalent to FILE SEEK <channel> 0.  Synonym: FREWIND.
  Also available as \F_rewind().
```

### FSEEK

```
Syntax: FILE SEEK [ switches ] <channel> { [{+,-}]<number>, EOF }
  Switches are /BYTE, /LINE, /RELATIVE, /ABSOLUTE, and /FIND:pattern.
  Moves the file pointer for this file to the given position in the
  file.  Subsequent FILE READs or WRITEs will take place at that position.
  If neither the /RELATIVE nor /ABSOLUTE switch is given, an unsigned
  <number> is absolute; a signed number is relative.  EOF means to move to
  the end of the file.  If a /FIND: switch is included, Kermit seeks to the
  specified spot (e.g. 0 for the beginning) and then begins searching line
  by line for the first line that matches the given pattern.  To start
  searching from the current file position specify a line number of +0.
  To start searching from the line after the current one, use +1 (etc).
  Synonym: FSEEK.
```

### FSTATUS

```
Syntax: FILE STATUS <channel>
  If the channel is open, this command shows the name of the file, the
  switches it was opened with, and the current read/write position.
  Synonym: FSTATUS
```

### FTP

```
Syntax: FTP subcommand [ operands ]
  Makes an FTP connection, or sends a command to the FTP server.
  To see a list of available FTP subcommands, type "ftp ?".
  and then use HELP FTP xxx to get help about subcommand xxx.
  Also see HELP SET FTP, HELP SET GET-PUT-REMOTE, and HELP FIREWALL.
```

### FUNCTION

```
KERMIT FUNCTIONS
   
  Functions are part of Kermit's programming language used in writing
  scripts.  They are like functions in other programming languages like C
  and Perl; each function has a name and an argument list, and it returns
  (is replaced by) a value.  In a Kermit script, the function name preceded
  by a backslash (\) and then the letter F; for example:
 
     \Findex(string1,string2).
 
  The argument list is in parentheses.  In this example the name of the
  function is 'index', the arguments are string1 and string2, and the return
  value is the starting position of string2 in string1; type HELP FUNC INDEX
  for details.
 
  Type SHOW FUNCTIONS to see a list of available functions.
 
  Type HELP FUNCTION xxx more information about specific functions:
 
   . If xxx matches only one function name the documentation for that
     function is printed; example: HELP FUNCTION INDEX.
 
  . If xxx matches more than one function name, a list of all functions
     whose names contain xxx is printed; example: HELP FUNCTION DATE.
```

### FWRITE

```
FILE WRITE [ switches ] <channel> <text>
  Writes the given text to the file on the given channel number.  The <text>
  can be literal text or a variable, or any combination.  If the text might
  contain leading or trailing spaces, it must be enclosed in braces if you
  want to preserve them.  Synonym: FWRITE.  Switches:
 
/LINE
  Specifies that an appropriate line terminator is to be added to the
  end of the <text>.  If no switches are included, /LINE is assumed.
 
/SIZE:number
  Specifies that the given number of bytes (characters) is to be written.
  If the given <text> is longer than the requested size, it is truncated;
  if is shorter, it is padded according /LPAD and /RPAD switches.  Synonym:
  /BLOCK.
 
/LPAD[:value]
  If /SIZE was given, but the <text> is shorter than the requested size,
  the text is padded on the left with sufficient copies of the character
  whose ASCII value is given to write the given length.  If no value is
  specified, 32 (the code for Space) is used.  The value can also be 0 to
  write the indicated number of NUL bytes.  If /SIZE was not given, this
  switch is ignored.
 
/RPAD[:value]
  Like LPAD, but pads on the right.
 
/STRING
  Specifies that the <text> is to be written as-is, with no terminator added.
 
/CHARACTER
  Specifies that one character should be written.  If the <text> is empty or
  not given, a NUL character is written; otherwise the first character of
  <text> is given.
 
Synonym FWRITE.
Also available as \F_putchar(), \F_putline(), \F_putblock().
```

### G

Synonym for [GET](#get).

### GE

Synonym for [GET](#get).

### GET

Synonyms: G, GE

```
Syntax: GET [ switches... ] remote-filespec [ as-name ]
  Tells the other Kermit, which must be in (or support autoswitching into)
  server mode, to send the named file or files.  If the remote-filespec or
  the as-name contain spaces, they must be enclosed in braces.  If as-name
  is the name of an existing local directory, incoming files are placed in
  that directory; if it is the name of directory that does not exist, Kermit
  tries to create it.  Optional switches include:
 
/AS-NAME:text
  Specifies "text" as the name to store the incoming file under, or
  directory to store it in.  You can also specify the as-name as the second
  filename on the GET command line.
 
/BINARY
  Performs this transfer in binary mode without affecting the global
  transfer mode.
 
/COMMAND
  Receives the file into the standard input of a command, rather than saving
  it on  disk.  The /AS-NAME or the second "filename" on the GET command
  line is interpreted as the name of a command.
 
/CONFIRM:{OFF,ON,ALL}
  Overrides the global SET RECEIVE CONFIRM setting for this transfer; see
  HELP SET RECEIVE.
 
/DELETE
  Asks the other Kermit to delete the file (or each file in the group)
  after it has been transferred successfully.
 
/EXCEPT:pattern
  Specifies that any files whose names match the pattern, which can be a
  regular filename, or may contain "*" and/or "?" metacharacters,
  are to be refused.  To specify multiple patterns (up to 8), use outer
  braces around the group, and inner braces around each pattern:
 
    /EXCEPT:{{pattern1}{pattern2}...}
 
/FILENAMES:{CONVERTED,LITERAL}
  Overrides the global SET FILE NAMES setting for this transfer only.
 
/FILTER:command
  Causes the incoming file to passed through the given command (standard
  input/output filter) before being written to disk.
 
/MOVE-TO:directory-name
  Specifies that each file that arrives should be moved to the specified
  directory after, and only if, it has been received successfully.
 
/PATHNAMES:{OFF,ABSOLUTE,RELATIVE,AUTO}
  Overrides the global SET RECEIVE PATHNAMES setting for this transfer.
 
/PIPES:{ON,OFF}
  Overrides the TRANSFER PIPES setting for this command only.  ON allows
  reception of files with names like "!tar xf -" to be automatically
  directed to a pipeline.
 
/QUIET
  Suppresses the file-transfer display.
 
/RECOVER
  Used to recover from a previously interrupted transfer; GET /RECOVER
  is equivalent REGET.  Works only in binary mode.
 
/RECURSIVE
  Tells the server to descend through the directory tree when locating
  the files to be sent.  The resulting pathnames are subject to your
  SET RECEIVE PATHNAMES setting; see HELP SET RECEIVE.
 
/RENAME-TO:string
  Specifies that each file that arrives should be renamed as specified
  after, and only if, it has been received successfully.  The string can
  be a filename, a directory name, an expression involving variables, etc.
 
/TEXT
  Performs this transfer in text mode without affecting the global
  transfer mode.
 
/TRANSPARENT
  Inhibits character-set translation of incoming text files for the duration
  of the GET command without affecting subsequent commands.
 
Also see HELP MGET, HELP SEND, HELP RECEIVE, HELP SERVER, HELP REMOTE.
```

### GETC

```
Syntax:  GETC [ switches] [ variablename [ prompt ] ]
Example: GETC \%c { Type any character to continue...}
  Issues the prompt and sets the variable to the first character you type.
  Use braces to preserve leading and/or trailing spaces in the prompt.
 
Switches:
  /CHECK
    GETC /CHECK (no variable or prompt is given when /CHECK is used)
   succeeds if characters are waiting to be read and fails if not.
 
  /QUIET
    In case of errors, no error message is issued.
 
  /TIMEOUT:n
    Gives GETC a time limit of n seconds to wait for a character to appear;
    if no character appears within n seconds, GETC fails and (if a /QUIET
    switch was not given, an error message is printed.
```

### GETOK

```
Syntax: GETOK [ switches ] prompt
  Prints the prompt, makes user type 'yes', 'no', or 'ok', and sets SUCCESS
  or FAILURE accordingly.  The optional switches are the same as for ASK.
```

### GOTO

```
Syntax: GOTO label
  In a TAKE file or macro, go to the given label.  A label is a word on the
  left margin that starts with a colon (:).  Example:

  :oofa
  echo Hello!
  goto oofa
```

### GREP

Synonym for [FIND](#find).

### H

### HTTP

```
Syntax:
HTTP [ <switches> ] OPEN [{ /SSL, /TLS }] <hostname> <service/port>
  Instructs Kermit to open a new connection for HTTP communication with
  the specified host on the specified port.  The default port is "http".
  If /SSL or /TLS are specified or if the service is "https" or port 443,
  a secure connection will be established using the current authentication
  settings.  See HELP SET AUTH for details.
  If <switches> are specified, they are applied to all subsequent HTTP
  actions (GET, PUT, ...) until an HTTP CLOSE command is executed.
  A URL can be included in place of the hostname and service or port.
 
HTTP CLOSE
  Instructs Kermit to close any open HTTP connection and clear any saved
  switch values.
 
HTTP [ <switches> ] CONNECT <host>[:<port>]
  Instructs the server to establish a connection with the specified host
  and to redirect all data transmitted between Kermit and the host for the
  life of the connection.
 
HTTP [ <switches> ] GET <remote-filename> [ <local-filename> ]
  Retrieves the named file on the currently open HTTP connection.  The
  default local filename is the same as the remote filename, but with any
  path stripped.  If you want the file to be displayed on the screen instead
  of stored on disk, include the /TOSCREEN switch and omit the local
  filename.  If you give a URL instead of a remote filename, this commands
  opens the connection, GETs the file, and closes the connection; the same
  is true for the remaining HTTP commands for which you can specify a
  remote filename, directory name, or path.
 
HTTP [ <switches> ] HEAD <remote-filename> [ <local-filename> ]
  Like GET except without actually getting the file; instead it gets only
  the headers, storing them into the given file (if a local filename is
  specified), one line per header item as shown in the /ARRAY: switch
  description.
 
HTTP [ <switches> ] INDEX <remote-directory> [ <local-filename> ]
  Retrieves the file listing for the given server directory.
  NOTE: This command is not supported by most Web servers, and even when
  the server understand it, there is no stardard response format.
 
HTTP [ <switches> ] POST [ /MIME-TYPE:<type> ] <local-file> <remote-path>
     [ <dest-file> ]
  Used to send a response as if it were sent from a form.  The data to be
  posted must be read from a file.
 
HTTP [ <switches> ] PUT [ /MIME-TYPE:<type> ] <local-file> <remote-file>
     [ <dest-file> ]
  Uploads the given local file to server file.  If the remote filename is
  omitted, the local name is used, but with any path stripped.
 
HTTP [ <switches> ] DELETE <remote-filename>
  Instructs the server to delete the specified filename.
 
where <switches> are:
/AGENT:<user-agent>
  Identifies the client to the server; "C-Kermit"
  by default.
 
/HEADER:<header-line>
  Used for specifying any optional headers.  A list of headers is provided
  using braces for grouping:
 
    /HEADER:{{tag:value}{tag:value}...}
 
  For a listing of valid "tag" value and "value" formats see RFC 1945:
  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0".  A maximum of eight headers
  may be specified.
 
/TOSCREEN
  Display server responses on the screen.
 
/USER:<name>
  In case a page requires a username for access.
 
/PASSWORD:<password>
  In case a page requires a password for access.
 
/ARRAY:<arrayname>
  Tells Kermit to store the response headers in the given array, one line
  per element.  The array need not be declared in advance.  Example:
 
    http /array:c get kermit/index.html
    show array c
    Dimension = 9

### I

Synonym for [INPUT](#input).

### IF

```
Syntax: IF [NOT] condition commandlist
 
If the condition is (is not) true, do the commandlist.  The commandlist
can be a single command, or a list of commands separated by commas or
enclosed in braces.  The condition can be a single condition or a group of
conditions separated by AND (&&) or OR (||) and enclosed in parentheses.
If parentheses are used they must be surrounded by spaces.  Examples:
 
  IF EXIST oofa.txt <command>
  IF ( EXIST oofa.txt || = \v(nday) 3 ) <command>
  IF ( EXIST oofa.txt || = \v(nday) 3 ) { <command>, <command>, ... }

  (variable name)    - If value numeric: succeeds if nonzero, fails if zero
                       NOTE: variable name must not be the same as keyword
 
The IF command may be followed on the next line by an ELSE command. Example:
 
  IF < \%x 10 ECHO It's less
  ELSE echo It's not less
 
It can also include an ELSE part on the same line if braces are used:
 
  IF < \%x 10 { ECHO It's less } ELSE { ECHO It's not less }
 
Multiple commands can be enclosed in braces, separated by commas:
 
  IF > \%n \m(max) { echo \%n > old max \m(max), .max := \%n }

      .max := \%n
  } else if < \%n \m(min) {
      echo "\%n less than old min \m(min)"
      .min := \%n
  }
 
Also see HELP WILDCARD (for IF MATCH pattern syntax).
```

### IKSD

```
Syntax: IKS [ switches ] [ host [ service ] ]
  Establishes a new connection to an Internet Kermit Service daemon.
  Equivalent to SET NETWORK TYPE TCP/IP, SET HOST host KERMIT /TELNET,
  IF SUCCESS CONNECT.  If host is omitted, the previous connection (if any)
  is resumed.  Depending on how Kermit has been built switches may be
  available to require a secure authentication method and bidirectional
  encryption.  See HELP SET TELNET for more info.
 
 /AUTH:<type> is equivalent to SET TELNET AUTH TYPE <type> and
   SET TELOPT AUTH REQUIRED with the following exceptions.  If the type
   is AUTO, then SET TELOPT AUTH REQUESTED is executed and if the type
   is NONE, then SET TELOPT AUTH REFUSED is executed.
 
 /ENCRYPT:<type> is equivalent to SET TELNET ENCRYPT TYPE <type>
   and SET TELOPT ENCRYPT REQUIRED REQUIRED with the following exceptions.
   If the type is AUTO then SET TELOPT AUTH REQUESTED REQUESTED is executed
   and if the type is NONE then SET TELOPT ENCRYPT REFUSED REFUSED is
   executed.
 
 /USERID:[<name>]
   This switch is equivalent to SET LOGIN USERID <name> or SET TELNET
   ENVIRONMENT USER <name>.  If a string is given, it sent to host during
   Telnet negotiations; if this switch is given but the string is omitted,
   no user ID is sent to the host.  If this switch is not given, your
   current USERID value, \v(userid), is sent.  When a userid is sent to the
   host it is a request to login as the specified user.
 
 /PASSWORD:[<string>]
   This switch is equivalent to SET LOGIN PASSWORD.  If a string is given,
   it is treated as the password to be used (if required) by any Telnet
   Authentication protocol (Kerberos Ticket retrieval, Secure Remote
   Password, or X.509 certificate private key decryption.)  If no password
   switch is specified a prompt is issued to request the password if one
   is required for the negotiated authentication method.
```

### IN

Synonym for [INPUT](#input).

### INCREMENT

```
Syntax: INCREMENT variablename [ number ]
  Increment (add one to) the value of a variable if the current value is
  numeric.  If an optional amount is specified (as a number, a variable,
  or an arithmetic expression that evaluates to a number, or any combination)
  the variable is incremented by that number instead of 1.  The result is
  always an integer.  If floating-point numbers are given, the result is
  truncated.
 
Examples: INCR \%a, INCR dollars 100, INCR size \%n, INCR total \%x/10
```

### INPUT

Synonyms: I, IN

```
Syntax:  INPUT [ /COUNT:n /CLEAR /NOMATCH /NOWRAP ] { number-of-seconds, time-of-day } [ text ]
 
Examples:
  INPUT 5 Login:
  INPUT 23:59:59 RING
  INPUT /NOMATCH 10
  INPUT /CLEAR 10 \13\10
  INPUT /CLEAR 10 \13\10$
  INPUT /COUNT:256 10
  INPUT 10 \fpattern(<*@*.*>)
 
  Waits up to the given number of seconds, or until the given time of day,
  for the given text to arrive on the connection. For use in script programs
  with IF FAILURE or IF SUCCESS, which tell whether the desired text arrived
  within the given amount of time.
 
  The text, if given, can be a regular text or it can be a \fpattern()
  invocation, in which case it is treated as a pattern rather than a literal
  string (HELP PATTERNS for details).
 
  If the /COUNT: switch is included, INPUT waits for the given number of
  characters to arrive.
 
  If no text is specified, INPUT waits for the first character that arrives
  and makes it available in the \v(inchar) variable.  This is equivalent to
  including a /COUNT: switch with an argument of 1.
 
  If the /NOMATCH switch is included, INPUT does not attempt to match any
  characters, but continues reading from the communication connection until
  the timeout interval expires.  If the timeout interval is 0, the INPUT
  command does not wait; i.e. the given text must already be available for
  reading for the INPUT command to succeed.  If the interval is negative,
  the INPUT command waits forever.
 
  The INPUT buffer, \v(input), is normally circular.  Incoming material is
  appended to it until it reaches the end, and then it wraps around to the
  beginning.  If the /CLEAR switch is given, INPUT clears its buffer before
  reading from the connection.
 
  Typical example of use:
 
    INPUT 10 login:
    IF FAIL EXIT 1 "Timed out waiting for login prompt"
    LINEOUT myuserid
    INPUT 10 Password:
    IF FAIL EXIT 1 "Timed out waiting for Password prompt"
    LINEOUT xxxxxxx
 
  The /NOWRAP switch means that INPUT should return with failure status
  and with \v(instatus) set to 6 if its internal buffer fills up before
  any of the other completion criteria are met.  This allows for capture
  of the complete incoming data stream (except NUL bytes, which are
  discarded).  CAUTION: if the search target (if any) spans the INPUT buffer
  boundary, INPUT will not succeed.
 
  \v(instatus) values are: 0 (success), 1 (timed out), 2 (keyboard interrupt),
  3 (internal error), 4 (I/O error or connection lost), 5 (INPUT disabled),
  and 6 (buffer filled and /NOWRAP set); these are shown by \v(inmessage).
 
  Also see OUTPUT, MINPUT, REINPUT, SET INPUT and CLEAR.  See HELP PAUSE for
  details on time-of-day format and HELP PATTERNS for pattern syntax.

```
Syntax: SET LOCUS { AUTO, LOCAL, REMOTE }
  Specifies whether unprefixed file management commands should operate
  locally or (when there is a connection to a remote FTP or Kermit
  server) sent to the server.  The affected commands are: CD (CWD), PWD,
  CDUP, DIRECTORY, DELETE, RENAME, MKDIR, and RMDIR.  To force any of
  these commands to be executed locally, give it an L-prefix: LCD, LDIR,
  etc.  To force remote execution, use the R-prefix: RCD, RDIR, and so
  on.  SHOW COMMAND shows the current Locus.
 
  By default, the Locus for file management commands is switched
  automatically whenever you make or close a connection: if you make an
  FTP connection, the Locus becomes REMOTE; if you close an FTP connection
  or make any other kind of connection, the Locus becomes LOCAL.
 
  If you give a SET LOCUS LOCAL or SET LOCUS REMOTE command, this sets
  the locus as indicated and disables automatic switching.
  SET LOCUS AUTO restores automatic switching.

the default for the connection log).  Use CLOSE <keyword> to stop logging.
 
Note: The filename can also be a pipe, e.g.:
 
  log transactions |lpr
  log debug {| grep "^TELNET" > debug.log}
 
Braces are required if the pipeline or filename contains spaces.

Example: MINPUT 5 Login: {Username: } {NO CARRIER} BUSY RING
  For use in script programs.  Waits up to n seconds for any one of the
  strings to arrive on the communication device.  If no strings are given,
  the command waits for any character at all to arrive.  Strings are
  separated by spaces; use {braces} or "doublequotes" for grouping.  If

```

### MOVE

```
  If LOCUS is REMOTE or LOCUS is AUTO and you have an FTP connection,
  this command is equivalent to REMOTE RENAME (RREN).  Otherwise:
 
Syntax: RENAME or MOVE or MV [ switches ] name1 [ name2 ]
  Renames the source file (name1) to the target name2.  If name2 is a
  directory, name1 is allowed to contain wildcards, and the file(s) matching
  name1 are moved to directory name2, subject to rules of the underlying
  operating system regarding renaming across disk boundaries, etc. Switches:
 
  /LIST
    Print the filenames and status while renaming.  Synonyms: /LOG, /VERBOSE
 
  /NOLIST
    Rename silently (default). Synonyms: /NOLOG, /QUIET
 
  /COLLISION:{FAIL,SKIP,OVERWRITE}
    Tells what to do if a file with the given (or derived) new name already
    exists: fail (and stop without renaming any files); skip this file
    without renaming it and go on to the next one, if any; or overwrite (the
    existing file).  PROCEED is a synonym for SKIP.
 
  /SIMULATE
    Show what the effects of the RENAME command would be without actually
    renaming any files.
 
  When any of the following switches is given, name2 must either be the
  the name of a directory, or else omitted, and name1 is allowed to contain
  contain wildcards, allowing multiple files to be renamed at once. If name2
  is given, then all files matching name1 are moved to the name2 directory
  after being renamed.
 
  /LOWER:{ALL,UPPER}
    Converts letters in the filename to lowercase.  ALL means to convert
    all matching filenames, UPPER means to convert only those filenames
    that contain no lowercase letters.  The switch argument can be omitted,
    in which case ALL filenames are converted.
 
  /UPPER:{ALL,LOWER}
    Converts letters in the filename to uppercase.  ALL means to convert
    all matching filenames, LOWER means to convert only those filenames
    that contain no uppercase letters.  As with /LOWER, ALL is the default
    switch argument.
 
  /FIXSPACES:s
    Replaces all spaces in each matching filename by the string s, which may
    be empty, a single character, or a string of characters.  The default
    replacement (if no argument is given) is underscore (_).
 
  /REPLACE:{{string1}{string2}{options}}
    Replaces all or selected occurrences of string1 with string2 in the
    matching filenames.  The braces are part of the command.  The options
    string can contain the following characters:
     A: String matching is case-sensitive.
     a: String matching is case-insensitive.
     ^: String matching is anchored to the beginning of the filename.
     $: String matching is anchored to the end of the filename.
     1: Only the first occurrence of the string (if any) will be changed.
     2: Only the second occurrence, and so on for all digits up to 9.
     -: (before a digit) Occurrences are counted from the right.
     ~: (before occurrence) All occurences BUT the one given are changed.
 
  /CONVERT:cset1:cset2
    Converts each matching filename from character-set 1 to character-set 2.
    Character sets are the same as for SET FILE CHARACTER-SET.
 
  Global values for /LIST and COLLISION can be set with SET RENAME and
  displayed with SHOW RENAME.

```

### O

Synonym for [OUTPUT](#output).

### OPEN

```
Syntax:  OPEN mode filename
  For use with READ and WRITE commands.  Open the local file in the
  specified mode: READ, WRITE, or APPEND.  !READ and !WRITE mean to read
  from or write to a system command rather than a file.  Examples:
 
    OPEN READ oofa.txt
    OPEN !READ sort foo.bar
```

### OPTIONS

```
Command-line options are given after the program name in the system
command that you use to start Kermit.  Example:
 
 kermit -i -s oofa.exe
 
tells Kermit to send (-s) the file oofa.exe in binary (-i) mode.
 
Command-line options are case-sensitive; "-s" is different from "-S".
 
If any "action options" are included on the command line, Kermit exits
after executing its command-line options.  If -S is included, or no action
options were given, Kermit enters its interactive command parser and
issues its prompt.
 
Command-line options are single characters preceded by dash (-).  Some
require an "argument," others do not.  If an argument contains spaces, it
must be enclosed in doublequotes:
 
 kermit -s "filename with spaces"
 
An option that does not require an argument can be bundled with other options:
 
 kermit -Qis oofa.exe
 
Exceptions to the rules:
 
 . If the first command-line option is a filename, Kermit executes commands
   from the file.  Additional command-line options can follow the filename.
 
 . The special option "=" (equal sign) or "--" (double hyphen) means to
   treat the rest of the command line as data, rather than commands; this
   data is placed in the argument vector array, \&@[], along with the other
   items on the command line, and also in the top-level \%1..\%9 variables.
 
 . A similar option "+" (plus sign) means: the name of a Kermit script
   file follows.  This file is to be executed, and its name assigned to \%0
   and \&_[0].  All subsequent command-line arguments are to be ignored by
   Kermit but made available to the script as \%1, \%2, ..., as well as
   in the argument-vector arrays.  The initialization file is not executed
   automatically in this case.
 
 . The -s option can accept multiple filenames, separated by spaces.
 
 . the -j and -J options allow an optional second argument, the TCP port
   name or number.
 
Type "help options all" to list all the command-line options.
Type "help option x" to see the help message for option x.
 
Kermit also offers a selection of "extended command-line" options.
These begin with two dashes, followed by a keyword, and then, if the option
has arguments, a colon (:) or equal sign (=) followed by the argument.
Unlike single-letter options, extended option keywords aren't case sensitive
and they can be abbreviated to any length that still distinguishes them from
other extended-option keywords.  Example:
 
  kermit --banner:oofa.txt
 
which designates the file oofa.txt to be printed upon startup, rather than
the built-in banner (greeting) text.  To obtain a list of available
extended options, type "help extended-options ?".  To get help about all
extended options, type "help extended-options".  To get help about a
particular extended option, type "help extended-option xxx", where "xxx"
is the option keyword.
```

### ORIENTATION

```
 Shows the directories important to Kermit.
```

### OUTPUT

Synonym: O

```
Syntax: OUTPUT text
  Sends the text out the communications connection, as if you had typed it
  during CONNECT mode.  The text may contain backslash codes, variables,
  etc, plus the following special codes:
 
    \N - Send a NUL (ASCII 0) character (you can't use \0 for this).
    \B - Send a BREAK signal.
    \L - Send a Long BREAK signal.
 
Also see SET OUTPUT.
```

### PASSIVE

```
Sorry, help not available for "passive"
```

### PATTERNS

```
A "pattern" is notation used in a search string when searching through
text.  C-Kermit uses three kinds of patterns: floating patterns, anchored
patterns, and wildcards.  Wildcards are anchored patterns that are used to
match file names; type HELP WILDCARD to learn about them.
 
In a pattern, certain characters are special:
 
* Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.  For example, "k*t"
  matches all strings that start with "k" and end with "t" including
  "kt", "kit", "knight", or "kermit".
 
? Matches any single character.  For example, "k????t" matches all strings
  that are exactly 6 characters long and start with "k" and end with
  with "t".  When typing commands at the prompt, you must precede any
  question mark to be used for matching by a backslash (\) to override the
  normal function of question mark in interactive commands, which is to
  provide menus and file lists.
 
[abc]
  Square brackets enclosing a list of characters matches any character in
  the list.  Example: h[aou]t matches hat, hot, and hut.
 
[a-z]
  Square brackets enclosing a range of characters matches any character in
  the range; a hyphen (-) separates the low and high elements of the range.
  For example, [a-z] matches any character from a to z.
 
[acdm-z]
  Lists and ranges may be combined.  This example matches a, c, d, or any
  letter from m through z.
 
{string1,string2,...}
  Braces enclose a list of strings to be matched.  For example:
  ker{mit,nel,beros} matches kermit, kernel, and kerberos.  The strings
  may themselves contain *, ?, [abc], [a-z], or other lists of strings.
 
To force a special pattern character to be taken literally, precede it with
a backslash, e.g. [a\-z] matches a, hyphen, or z rather than a through z.
 
A floating  pattern can also include the following special characters:
 
^ (First character of pattern) Anchors the pattern at the beginning.
$ (Last character of pattern) Anchors the pattern at the end.
 
If a floating pattern does not start with "^", the pattern can match
anywhere in the string instead of only at the beginning; in other words, a
leading "*" is assumed.  Similarly, if the pattern doesn't end with "$",
a trailing "*" is assumed.
 
The following commands and functions use floating patterns:
  GREP [ <switches> ] <pattern> <filespec>
  TYPE /MATCH:<pattern> <file>
  \farraylook(<pattern>,<arrayname>)
  \fsearch(<pattern>,<string>[,<offset>])
  \frsearch(<pattern>,<string>[,<offset>])
  The /EXCEPT: clause in SEND, GET, DELETE, etc.
 
Example:
  \fsearch(abc,xxabcxxx) succeeds because xxabcxx contains abc.
  \fsearch(^abc,xxabcxx) fails because xxabcxx does not start with abc.
 
All other commands and functions use anchored patterns, meaning that ^ and $
are not treated specially, and * is not assumed at the beginning or end of
the pattern.  This is true mainly of filename patterns (wildcards), since
you would not want a command like "delete x" to delete all files whose
names contained "x"!
 
You can use anchored patterns not only in filenames, but also in SWITCH
case labels, in the INPUT and MINPUT commands, and in file binary- and
text-patterns for filenames.  The IF MATCH pattern is also anchored.
```

### PAUSE

Synonym: SLEEP

```
Syntax:  PAUSE [ { number-of-seconds, hh:mm:ss } ]
Example: PAUSE 3  or  PAUSE 14:52:30
  Do nothing for the specified number of seconds or until the given time of
  day in 24-hour hh:mm:ss notation.  If the time of day is earlier than the
  current time, it is assumed to be tomorrow.  If no argument given, one
  second is used.  The pause can be interrupted by typing any character on
  the keyboard unless SLEEP CANCELLATION is OFF.  If interrupted, PAUSE
  fails, otherwise it succeeds.  Synonym: SLEEP.
```

### PDIAL

```
Syntax: PDIAL phonenumber

### PROMPT

```
Syntax: PROMPT [ text ]
  Enters interactive command level from within a script in such a way that
  the script can be continued with an END or RETURN command.  STOP, EXIT,
  SHOW STACK, TRACE, and Ctrl-C all have their normal effects.  The PROMPT
  command allows variables to be examined or changed, or any other commands
  to be given, in any number, prior to returning to the script, allowing
  Kermit to serve as its own debugger; adding the PROMPT command to a script
  is like setting a breakpoint.  If the optional text is included, it is
  used as the new prompt for this level, e.g. "prompt Breakpoint_1>".
```

### PSEND

```
Syntax: PSEND filespec position [name]

  Just like SEND, except sends the file starting at the given byte position.

  to be purged.
 
/EXCEPT:pattern
  Specifies that any files whose names match the pattern, which can be a
  regular filename or may contain wildcards, are not to be purged.  To
  specify multiple patterns (up to 8), use outer braces around the group
  and inner braces around each pattern:
 
    /EXCEPT:{{pattern1}{pattern2}...}
 
/DOTFILES
  Include (purge) files whose names begin with ".".
 
/NODOTFILES
  Skip (don't purge) files whose names begin with ".".
 
/RECURSIVE
  Descends through the current or specified directory tree.

/NOPAGE
  Don't pause, even if COMMAND MORE-PROMPTING is ON.
 
/ASK
  Interactively ask permission to delete each backup file.
 
/NOASK
  Purge backup files without asking permission.
 
/SIMULATE

display customized defaults.  Also see HELP DELETE, HELP WILDCARD.
```

### PUSH

Synonyms: !, @, PU, RUN, SPAWN

```
Syntax: !, @, RUN, PUSH, or SPAWN, optionally followed by a command.
  Gives the command to the local operating system's command processor, and
  displays the results on the screen.  If the command is omitted, enters the
  system's command line interpreter or shell; exit from it (the command for
  this is usually EXIT or QUIT or LOGOUT) to return to Kermit.
```

### PUT

Synonym for [SEND](#send).

### PUTENV

```
Syntax: PUTENV name value
  Creates or modifies the environment variable with the given name to have
  the given value.  Purpose: to pass parameters to subprocesses without
  having them appear on the command line.  If the value is blank (empty),
  the variable is deleted.  The result is visible to this instantiation of
  C-Kermit via \$(name) and to any inferior processes by whatever method
  they use to access environment variables.  The value may be enclosed in
  doublequotes or braces, but it need not be; if it is the outermost
  doublequotes or braces are removed.
 
  Note the syntax:
    PUTENV name value
  not:
    PUTENV name=value
 
  There is no equal sign between name and value, and the name itself may
  not include an equal sign.

  (see OPEN).
```

### RECEIVE

Synonym: R

```
Syntax: RECEIVE (or R) [ switches... ] [ as-name ]
  Wait for a file to arrive from the other Kermit, which must be given a
  SEND command.  If the optional as-name is given, the incoming file or
  files are stored under that name, otherwise it will be stored under
  the name it arrives with.  If the filespec denotes a directory, the
  incoming file or files will be placed in that directory.
 
Optional switches include:
 
/AS-NAME:text
  Specifies "text" as the name to store the incoming file under.
  You can also specify the as-name as a filename on the command line.
 
/BINARY
  Skips text-mode conversions unless the incoming file arrives with binary
  attribute
 
/CALIBRATE
  Discards the incoming data instead of writing it to disk.  Used to
  measure transfer performance without filesystem overhead.
 
/COMMAND
  Receives the file into the standard input of a command, rather than saving
  it on disk.  The /AS-NAME or the "filename" on the RECEIVE command line
  is interpreted as the name of a command.
 
/CONFIRM:{OFF,ON,ALL}
  Overrides the global SET RECEIVE CONFIRM setting for this transfer; see
  HELP SET RECEIVE.  Since RECEIVE never supplies a name to match incoming
  files against, ON and ALL both cause every incoming file to require
  confirmation.
 
/EXCEPT:pattern
  Specifies that any files whose names match the pattern, which can be a
  regular filename, or may contain "*" and/or "?" metacharacters,
  are to be refused.  To specify multiple patterns (up to 8), use outer
  braces around the group, and inner braces around each pattern:
 
    /EXCEPT:{{pattern1}{pattern2}...}
 
/FILENAMES:{CONVERTED,LITERAL}
  Overrides the global SET FILE NAMES setting for this transfer only.
 
/FILTER:command
  Causes the incoming file to passed through the given command (standard
  input/output filter) before being written to disk.
 
/MOVE-TO:directory-name
  Specifies that each file that arrives should be moved to the specified
  directory after, and only if, it has been received successfully.
 
/PATHNAMES:{OFF,ABSOLUTE,RELATIVE,AUTO}
  Overrides the global SET RECEIVE PATHNAMES setting for this transfer.
 
/PIPES:{ON,OFF}
  Overrides the TRANSFER PIPES setting for this command only.  ON allows
  reception of files with names like "!tar xf -" to be automatically
  directed to a pipeline.
 
/PROTOCOL:name
  Use the given protocol to receive the incoming file(s).
 
/QUIET
  When receiving in local mode, this suppresses the file-transfer display.
 
/RECURSIVE
  Equivalent to /PATHNAMES:RELATIVE.
 
/RENAME-TO:string
  Specifies that each file that arrives should be renamed as specified
  after, and only if, it has been received successfully.  The string should
  normally contain variables like \v(filename) or \v(filenum).
 
/TEXT
  Forces text-mode conversions unless the incoming file has the binary
  attribute
 
/TRANSPARENT
  Inhibits character-set translation of incoming text files for the duration
  of the RECEIVE command without affecting subsequent commands.

### RENAME

Synonyms: MOVE, MV

```
  If LOCUS is REMOTE or LOCUS is AUTO and you have an FTP connection,
  this command is equivalent to REMOTE RENAME (RREN).  Otherwise:
 
Syntax: RENAME or MOVE or MV [ switches ] name1 [ name2 ]
  Renames the source file (name1) to the target name2.  If name2 is a
  directory, name1 is allowed to contain wildcards, and the file(s) matching
  name1 are moved to directory name2, subject to rules of the underlying
  operating system regarding renaming across disk boundaries, etc. Switches:
 
  /LIST
    Print the filenames and status while renaming.  Synonyms: /LOG, /VERBOSE
 
  /NOLIST
    Rename silently (default). Synonyms: /NOLOG, /QUIET
 
  /COLLISION:{FAIL,SKIP,OVERWRITE}
    Tells what to do if a file with the given (or derived) new name already
    exists: fail (and stop without renaming any files); skip this file
    without renaming it and go on to the next one, if any; or overwrite (the
    existing file).  PROCEED is a synonym for SKIP.
 
  /SIMULATE
    Show what the effects of the RENAME command would be without actually
    renaming any files.
 
  When any of the following switches is given, name2 must either be the
  the name of a directory, or else omitted, and name1 is allowed to contain
  contain wildcards, allowing multiple files to be renamed at once. If name2
  is given, then all files matching name1 are moved to the name2 directory
  after being renamed.
 
  /LOWER:{ALL,UPPER}
    Converts letters in the filename to lowercase.  ALL means to convert
    all matching filenames, UPPER means to convert only those filenames
    that contain no lowercase letters.  The switch argument can be omitted,
    in which case ALL filenames are converted.
 
  /UPPER:{ALL,LOWER}
    Converts letters in the filename to uppercase.  ALL means to convert
    all matching filenames, LOWER means to convert only those filenames
    that contain no uppercase letters.  As with /LOWER, ALL is the default
    switch argument.
 
  /FIXSPACES:s
    Replaces all spaces in each matching filename by the string s, which may
    be empty, a single character, or a string of characters.  The default
    replacement (if no argument is given) is underscore (_).
 
  /REPLACE:{{string1}{string2}{options}}
    Replaces all or selected occurrences of string1 with string2 in the
    matching filenames.  The braces are part of the command.  The options
    string can contain the following characters:
     A: String matching is case-sensitive.
     a: String matching is case-insensitive.
     ^: String matching is anchored to the beginning of the filename.
     $: String matching is anchored to the end of the filename.
     1: Only the first occurrence of the string (if any) will be changed.
     2: Only the second occurrence, and so on for all digits up to 9.
     -: (before a digit) Occurrences are counted from the right.
     ~: (before occurrence) All occurences BUT the one given are changed.
 
  /CONVERT:cset1:cset2
    Converts each matching filename from character-set 1 to character-set 2.
    Character sets are the same as for SET FILE CHARACTER-SET.
 
  Global values for /LIST and COLLISION can be set with SET RENAME and
  displayed with SHOW RENAME.

control-character unprefixing at the risk of possible failure on some
connections.  FAST is the default tuning in C-Kermit 7.0 and later.  In case
FAST file transfers fail for you on a particular connection, try CAUTIOUS.
If that fails too, try ROBUST.  You can also change the definitions of each
macro with the DEFINE command.  To see the current definitions, type
"show macro fast", "show macro cautious", or "show macro robust".

### SCREEN

```
Syntax: SCREEN { CLEAR, CLEOL, MOVE row column }
  Performs screen-formatting actions.  Correct operation of these commands
  depends on proper terminal setup on both ends of the connection -- mainly
  that the host terminal type is set to agree with the kind of terminal or
  the emulation you are viewing C-Kermit through.
 
SCREEN CLEAR
  Moves the cursor to home position and clears the entire screen.
  Synonyms: CLS, CLEAR SCREEN.
 
SCREEN CLEOL
  Clears from the current cursor position to the end of the line.
 
SCREEN MOVE row column
  Moves the cursor to the indicated row and column.  The row and column
  numbers are 1-based so on a 24x80 screen, the home position is 1 1 and

  SHOW VARIABLE TERMINAL, SHOW VARIABLE COLS, SHOW VAR ROWS, SHOW COMMAND.
```

### SCRIPT

Synonyms: SC, SCR

```
Syntax: SCRIPT text
  A limited and cryptic "login assistant", carried over from old C-Kermit
  releases for comptability, but not recommended for use.  Instead, please
  use the full script programming language described in chapters 17-19 of
  "Using C-Kermit".
 
  Login to a remote system using the text provided.  The login script
  is intended to operate similarly to UNIX uucp "L.sys" entries.
  A login script is a sequence of the form:
 
    expect send [expect send] . . .
 
  where 'expect' is a prompt or message to be issued by the remote site, and
  'send' is the names, numbers, etc, to return.  The send may also be the
  keyword EOT to send Control-D, or BREAK (or \\b) to send a break signal.
  Letters in send may be prefixed by ~ to send special characters:
 
  ~b backspace, ~s space, ~q '?', ~n linefeed, ~r return, ~c don't
  append a return, and ~o[o[o]] for octal of a character.  As with some
  UUCP systems, sent strings are followed by ~r unless they end with ~c.
 
  Only the last 7 characters in each expect are matched.  A null expect,
  e.g. ~0 or two adjacent dashes, causes a short delay.  If you expect
  that a sequence might not arrive, as with uucp, conditional sequences
  may be expressed in the form:
 
    -send-expect[-send-expect[...]]
 
  where dashed sequences are followed as long as previous expects fail.
```

### SEARCH

Synonym for [FIND](#find).

### SEND

Synonyms: PUT, S

```
Syntax: SEND (or S) [ switches...] [ filespec [ as-name ] ]
  Sends the file or files specified by filespec.  If the filespec is omitted
  the SEND-LIST is used (HELP ADD for more info).  The filespec may contain
  wildcard characters.  An 'as-name' may be given to specify the name(s)
  the files(s) are sent under; if the as-name is omitted, each file is
  sent under its own name.  Also see HELP MSEND, HELP WILDCARD.
  Optional switches include:
 
/ARRAY:<arrayname>
  Specifies that the data to be sent comes from the given array, such as
  \&a[].  A range may be specified, e.g. SEND /ARRAY:&a[100:199].  Leave
  the brackets empty or omit them altogether to send the whole 1-based array.
  Include /TEXT to have Kermit supply a line terminator at the end of each
  array element (and translate character sets if character-set translations
  are set up), or /BINARY to treat the array as one long string of characters
  to be sent as-is.  If an as-name is not specified, the array is sent with
  the name _ARRAY_X_, where "X" is replaced by actual array letter.
 
/AS-NAME:<text>
  Specifies <text> as the name to send the file under instead of its real
  name.  This is equivalent to giving an as-name after the filespec.
 
/BINARY
  Performs this transfer in binary mode without affecting the global
  transfer mode.
 
/TEXT
  Performs this transfer in text mode without affecting the global
  transfer mode.
 
/TRANSPARENT
  Inhibits character-set translation for text files for the duration of
  the SEND command without affecting subsequent commands.
 
/CALIBRATE:n
  Sends n Kbytes of generated data instead of an actual file.  Used to
  measure transfer performance without file-system overhead.  The colon
  is required; if n itself is omitted, 1024 Kbytes are sent.
 
/NOBACKUPFILES
  Skip (don't send) Kermit or EMACS backup files (files with names that
  end with .~n~, where n is a number).
 
/DOTFILES
  Include (send) files whose names begin with ".".
 
/NODOTFILES
  Don't send files whose names begin with ".".
 
/FOLLOWLINKS
  Send files that are pointed to by symbolic links.
 
/NOFOLLOWLINKS
  Skip over symbolic links (default).
 
/COMMAND
  Sends the output from a command, rather than the contents of a file.
  The first "filename" on the SEND command line is interpreted as the name
  of a command; the second (if any) is the as-name.  The output is considered
  to consist of both stdout and stderr.  The given command should be
  surrounded by double quotes if it contains spaces, and will be interpreted
  by a shell.
 
/FILENAMES:{CONVERTED,LITERAL}
  Overrides the global SET FILE NAMES setting for this transfer only.
 
/PATHNAMES:{OFF,ABSOLUTE,RELATIVE}
  Overrides the global SET SEND PATHNAMES setting for this transfer.
 
/FILTER:command
  Specifies a command (standard input/output filter) to pass the file through
  before sending it.
 
/DELETE
  Deletes the file (or each file in the group) after it has been sent
  successfully (applies only to real files).
 
/QUIET
  When sending in local mode, this suppresses the file-transfer display.
 
/RECOVER
  Used to recover from a previously interrupted transfer; SEND /RECOVER
  is equivalent RESEND (use in binary mode only).
 
/RECURSIVE
  Tells C-Kermit to look not only in the given or current directory for
  files that match the filespec, but also in all its subdirectories, and
  all their subdirectories, etc.  Where the resulting files land is
  governed by the receiving Kermit's SET RECEIVE PATHNAMES setting, not
  by anything set here; see HELP SET RECEIVE.
 
/RENAME-TO:name
  Tells C-Kermit to rename each source file that is sent successfully to
  the given name (usually you should include \v(filename) in the new name,
  which is replaced by the original filename.
 
/MOVE-TO:directory
  Tells C-Kermit to move each source file that is sent successfully to
  the given directory.
 
/STARTING:number
  Starts sending the file from the given byte position.
  SEND /STARTING:n filename is equivalent to PSEND filename n.
 
/SUBJECT:text
  Specifies the subject of an email message, to be used with /MAIL.  If the
  text contains spaces, it must be enclosed in braces.
 
/MAIL:address
  Sends the file as e-mail to the given address; use with /SUBJECT:.
 
/PRINT:options
  Sends the file to be printed, with optional options for the printer.
 
/PROTOCOL:name
  Uses the given protocol to send the file (Kermit, Zmodem, etc) for this
  transfer without changing global protocol.
 
/AFTER:date-time
  Specifies that only those files modified after the given date-time are
  to be sent.  HELP DATE for info about date-time formats.
 
/BEFORE:date-time
  Specifies that only those files modified before the given date-time
  are to be sent.
 
/NOT-AFTER:date-time
  Specifies that only those files modified at or before the given date-time
  are to be sent.
 
/NOT-BEFORE:date-time
  Specifies that only those files modified at or after the given date-time
  are to be sent.
 
/LARGER-THAN:number
  Specifies that only those files longer than the given number of bytes are
  to be sent.
 
/SMALLER-THAN:number
  Specifies that only those files smaller than the given number of bytes are
  to be sent.
 
/EXCEPT:pattern
  Specifies that any files whose names match the pattern, which can be a
  regular filename, or may contain "*" and/or "?" metacharacters,
  are not to be sent.  To specify multiple patterns (up to 8), use outer
  braces around the group, and inner braces around each pattern:
 
    /EXCEPT:{{pattern1}{pattern2}...}
 
/TYPE:{ALL,TEXT,BINARY}
  Send only files of the given type (see SET FILE SCAN).
 
/LISTFILE:filename
  Specifies the name of a file that contains the list of names of files
  that are to be sent.  The filenames should be listed one name per line
  in this file (but a name can contain wildcards).

```

### SERVER

```
Syntax: SERVER
  Enter server mode on the current connection.  All further commands
  are taken in packet form from the other Kermit program.  Use FINISH,
  BYE, or REMOTE EXIT to get C-Kermit out of server mode.
```

### SET

```
  The SET command establishes communication, file, scripting, or other
  parameters.  The SHOW command can be used to display the values of
  SET parameters.  Help is available for each individual parameter;
  type HELP SET ? to see what's available.
```

### SEXPRESSION

Synonym: (

```
Syntax: (operation operand [ operand [ ... ] ])
 
  C-Kermit includes a simple LISP-like S-Expression parser operating on
  numbers only.  An S-Expression is always enclosed in parentheses.  The
  parentheses can contain (a) a number, (b) a variable, (c) a function that
  returns a number, or (d) an operator followed by one or more operands.
  Operands can be any of (a) through (c) or an S-Expression.  Numbers can be
  integers or floating-point.  Any operand that is not a number and does not
  start with backslash (\) is treated as a Kermit macro name.  Operators:
 
 Operator  Action                                 Example           Value
  EVAL (.)  Returns the contained value            (6)               6
  QUOTE (') Inhibits evaluation of following value (quote a)         a
  SETQ      Assigns a value to a global variable   (setq a 2)        2

  LOG10     Log base 10 of given number            (log10 1000)      3.0
 
Predicate operators return 0 if false, 1 if true, and if it is the outermost
operator, sets SUCCESS or FAILURE accordingly:
 
  <         Operands in strictly descending order  (< 6 5 4 3 2 1)   1
  <=        Operands in descending order           (<= 6 6 5 4 3 2)  1

  >         Operands in strictly ascending order   (> 1 2 3 4 5 6)   1
  >=        Operands in ascending order            (> 1 1 2 3 4 5)   1
  AND (&&)  Operands are all true                  (and 1 1 1 1 0)   0
  OR  (||)  At least one operand is true           (or 1 1 1 1 0)    1
  XOR       Logical Exclusive OR                   (xor 3 1)         0
  NOT (!)   Reverses truth value of operand        (not 3)           0
 
Bit-oriented operators:
 
  &         Bitwise AND                            (& 7 2)           2
  |         Bitwise OR                             (| 1 2 3 4)       7
  #         Bitwise Exclusive OR                   (# 3 1)           2
  ~         Reverses all bits                      (~ 3)            -4
 
Operators that work on truth values:
 
  IF        Conditional evaluation                 (if (1) 2 3)      2
 
Operators can also be names of Kermit macros that return either numeric
values or no value at all.
 
Built-in constants are:
 
  t         True (1)
  nil       False (empty)
  pi        The value of Pi (3.1415926...)
 
If SET SEXPRESSION TRUNCATE-ALL-RESULTS is ON, all results are trunctated
to integer values by discarding any fractional part.  Otherwise results
are floating-point if there fractional part and integer otherwise.
If SET SEXPRESSION ECHO-RESULT is AUTO (the default), the value of the
S-Expression is printed if the S-Expression is given at top level; if ON,
it is printed at any level; if OFF it is not printed.  At all levels, the
variable \v(sexpression) is set to the most recent S-Expression, and
\v(svalue) is set to its value.  You can use the \fsexpresssion() function
to evaluate an S-Expression anywhere in a Kermit command.

```

### SLEEP

Synonym for [PAUSE](#pause).

### SORT

```
Syntax: ARRAY verb operands...
 
Declares arrays and performs various operations on them.  Arrays have
the following syntax:
 
  \&a[n]
 
where "a" is a letter and n is a number or a variable with a numeric value
or an arithmetic expression.  The value of an array element can be anything
at all -- a number, a character, a string, a filename, etc.
 
The following ARRAY verbs are available:
 
[ ARRAY ] DECLARE arrayname[n] [ = initializers... ]
  Declares an array of the given size, n.  The resulting array has n+1
  elements, 0 through n.  Array elements can be used just like any other
  variables.  Initial values can be given for elements 1, 2, ... by
  including = followed by one or more values separated by spaces.  If you
  omit the size, the array is sized according to the number of initializers;
  if none are given the array is destroyed and undeclared if it already
  existed.  The ARRAY keyword is optional.  Synonym: [ ARRAY ] DCL.
 
[ ARRAY ] UNDECLARE arrayname
  Destroys and undeclares the given array.  Synonym: ARRAY DESTROY.
 
ARRAY SHOW [ arrayname ]
  Displays the contents of the given array.  A range specifier can be
  included to display a segment of the array, e.g. "array show \&a[1:24]."
  If the arrayname is omitted, all declared arrays are listed, but their
  contents is not shown.  Synonym: SHOW ARRAY.
 
ARRAY CLEAR arrayname
  Clears all elements of the array, i.e. sets them to empty values.
  You may include a range specifier to clear a segment of the array rather
  than the whole array, e.g. "array clear \%a[22:38]"
 
ARRAY SET arrayname value
  Sets all elements of the array to the given value.  You may specify a
  range to set a segment of the array, e.g. "array set \%a[2:9] 0"
 
ARRAY RESIZE arrayname number
  Changes the size of the given array, which must already exist, to the
  number given.  If the number is smaller than the current size, the extra
  elements are discarded; if it is larger, new empty elements are added.
 
ARRAY COPY array1 array2
  Copies array1 to array2.  If array2 has not been declared, it is created
  automatically.  If it array2 does exist, array1 is copied INTO it, as
  much as will fit.  Range specifiers may be given on one or both arrays.
 
ARRAY LINK array1 arra2
  Makes array1 a link to array2.
 
[ ARRAY ] SORT [ switches ] array-name [ array2 ]
  Sorts the given array lexically according to the switches.  Element 0 of
  the array is excluded from sorting by default.  The ARRAY keyword is
  optional.  If a second array name is given, that array is sorted according
  to the first one.  Switches:
 
  /CASE:{ON,OFF}
    If ON, alphabetic case matters; if OFF it is ignored.  If this switch is
    omitted, the current SET CASE setting applies.
 
  /KEY:number
    Position (1-based column number) at which comparisons begin, 1 by default.
 
  /NUMERIC
    Specifies a numeric rather than lexical sort.
 
  /RANGE:low[:high]
    The range of elements, low through high, to be sorted.  If this switch
    is not given, elements 1 through the dimensioned size are sorted.  If
    :high is omitted, the dimensioned size is used.  To include element 0 in
    a sort, use /RANGE:0 (to sort the whole array) or /RANGE:0:n (to sort
    elements 0 through n).  You can use a range specifier in the array name
    instead of the /RANGE switch.
 
  /REVERSE
    Sort in reverse order.  If this switch is not given, the array is sorted
    in ascending order.
 
Various functions are available for array operations; see HELP FUNCTION for
details.  These include \fdimension(), \farraylook(), \ffiles(), \fsplit(),
and many more.

```

### SUPPORT

Synonym: BUG

```
Describes how to get technical support.
```

### SUSPEND

  such as fg.
```

### SWITCH

```
Syntax: SWITCH <variable> { case-list }
  Selects from a group of commands based on the value of a variable.
  The case-list is a series of lines like these:
 
    :x, command, command, ..., break
 
  where "x" is a possible value for the variable.  At the end of the
  case-list, you can put a "default" label to catch when the variable does
  not match any of the labels:
 
    :default, command, command, ...
 
The case label "x" can be a character, a string, a variable, a function
invocation, a pattern, or any combination of these.  See HELP WILDCARDS
for information about patterns.
```

### TA

Synonym for [TAKE](#take).

### TAIL

```
Syntax: TAIL [ switches ] filename
  Equivalent to TYPE /TAIL filename; see HELP TYPE.
```

### TAKE

Synonym: TA

```
Syntax: TAKE filename [ arguments ]
  Tells Kermit to execute commands from the named file.  Optional argument
  words, are automatically assigned to the macro argument variables \%1
  through \%9.  Kermit command files may themselves contain TAKE commands,
  up to any reasonable depth of nesting.
```

### TAPI

```
 This command is not configured in this version of Kermit.
```

### TEL

Synonym for [TELNET](#telnet).

### TELNET

Synonym: TEL

```
Syntax: TELNET [ switches ] [ host [ service ] ]
  Equivalent to SET NETWORK TYPE TCP/IP, SET HOST host [ service ] /TELNET,
  IF SUCCESS CONNECT.  If host is omitted, the previous connection (if any)
  is resumed.  Depending on how Kermit has been built switches may be
  available to require a secure authentication method and bidirectional
  encryption.  See HELP SET TELNET for more info.
 
 /AUTH:<type> is equivalent to SET TELNET AUTH TYPE <type> and
   SET TELOPT AUTH REQUIRED with the following exceptions.  If the type
   is AUTO, then SET TELOPT AUTH REQUESTED is executed and if the type
   is NONE, then SET TELOPT AUTH REFUSED is executed.
 
 /ENCRYPT:<type> is equivalent to SET TELNET ENCRYPT TYPE <type>
   and SET TELOPT ENCRYPT REQUIRED REQUIRED with the following exceptions.
   If the type is AUTO then SET TELOPT AUTH REQUESTED REQUESTED is executed
   and if the type is NONE then SET TELOPT ENCRYPT REFUSED REFUSED is
   executed.
 
 /USERID:[<name>]
   This switch is equivalent to SET LOGIN USERID <name> or SET TELNET
   ENVIRONMENT USER <name>.  If a string is given, it sent to host during
   Telnet negotiations; if this switch is given but the string is omitted,
   no user ID is sent to the host.  If this switch is not given, your
   current USERID value, \v(userid), is sent.  When a userid is sent to the
   host it is a request to login as the specified user.
 
 /PASSWORD:[<string>]
   This switch is equivalent to SET LOGIN PASSWORD.  If a string is given,
   it is treated as the password to be used (if required) by any Telnet
   Authentication protocol (Kerberos Ticket retrieval, Secure Remote
   Password, or X.509 certificate private key decryption.)  If no password
   switch is specified a prompt is issued to request the password if one
   is required for the negotiated authentication method.
```

### TELOPT

```
TELOPT { AO, AYT, BREAK, CANCEL, EC, EL, EOF, EOR, GA, IP, DMARK, NOP, SE,
         SUSP, SB [ option ], DO [ option ], DONT [ option ],
         WILL [ option ], WONT [option] }
  This command lets you send all the Telnet protocol commands.  Note that
  certain commands do not require a response, and therefore can be used as
  nondestructive "probes" to see if the Telnet session is still open;
  e.g.:
 
    set host xyzcorp.com
    ...
    telopt nop
    telopt nop
    if fail stop 1 Connection lost
 
  TELOPT NOP is sent twice because the failure of the connection will not
  be detected until the second send is attempted.  This command is meant
  primarily as a debugging tool for the expert user.
```

### TERMINAL

  Updates the modification time of the given file or files to the current
  date and time or to the date and time specified in the /MODTIME: switch.
  If the filespec is the name of a single file that does not exist, the file
  is created.  The following switches can be used to restrict the files
  to be touched according to various criteria:
 
   /FILES           Select files but not directories.
   /DIRECTORIES     Select directories but not files.
   /ALL           + Select both files and directories.
   /AFTER:          Select files modified after the given date
   /BEFORE:         Select files modified before the given date
   /LARGER:         Select files larger than the given size in bytes
   /SMALLER:        Select files smaller than the given size in bytes
   /EXCEPT:         Exclude the given files (list or pattern)
   /DOTFILES        Include files whose names start with dot (period).
   /NODOTFILES    + Don't include files whose names start with dot.
   /FOLLOWLINKS     For symbolic link touch the linked-to file, not the link
   /NOFOLLOWLINKS + Select the link itself, not the file it links to.
   /NOLINKS         Skip over symbolic links.
   /BACKUP        + Include backup files (names end with .~n~).
   /NOBACKUPFILES   Don't include backup files.
   /TYPE:           Select only files of the given type, TEXT or BINARY.
   /RECURSIVE       Descend through subdirectories.
   /NORECURSIVE   + Don't descend through subdirectories.
 
 Action switches:
 
   /MODTIME:        Changes the modification time for the selected files.
                     in numeric yyyy:mm:dd:hh:mm:ss format.
                     if hh:mm:ss omitted time is set to 00:00:00
   /SIMULATE        List files that would be touched, but don't touch them.
   /LIST            Show which files are being touched.
 
Factory defaults are marked with +.  Use HELP DATE to learn the date-time
formats usable with /MODTIME:.  If a /MODTIME: switch is not given, each
selected file gets a modification time equal to the current clock time.
You can use the /SIMULATE switch in combination with other switches to see
which files will be affected without actually changing their dates.

### TRACE

```
Syntax: TRACE { /ON, /OFF } { ASSIGNMENTS, COMMAND-LEVEL, ALL }
  Turns tracing of the given object on or off.
```

### TRANSLATE

Synonym for [CONVERT](#convert).

### TRANSMIT

Synonyms: XM, XMIT

```
Syntax: TRANSMIT [ switches ] filename
  Sends the contents of a file, without any error checking or correction,
  to the computer on the other end of your SET LINE or SET HOST connection
  (or if C-Kermit is in remote mode, displays it on the screen).  The
  filename is the name of a single file (no wildcards) to be sent or, if
  the /PIPE switch is included, the name of a command whose output is to be
  sent.
 
  The file is sent according to your current FILE TYPE setting (BINARY or
  TEXT), which you can override with a /BINARY or /TEXT switch without
  changing the global setting.  In text mode, it is sent a line at a time,
  with carriage return at the end of each line (as if you were typing it at
  your keyboard), and C-Kermit waits for a linefeed to echo before sending
  the next line; use /NOWAIT to eliminate the feedback requirement.  In
  binary mode, it is sent a character at a time, with no feedback required.
 
  Normally the transmitted material is echoed to your screen.  Use SET
  TRANSMIT ECHO OFF or the /NOECHO switch to suppress echoing.  Note that
  TRANSMIT /NOECHO /NOWAIT /BINARY is a special case, that more or less
  blasts the file out at full speed.
 
  Character sets are translated according to your current FILE and TERMINAL
  CHARACTER-SET settings when TRANSMIT is in text mode.  Include /TRANSPARENT
  to disable character-set translation in text mode (/TRANSPARENT implies
  /TEXT).
 
  There can be no guarantee that the other computer will receive the file
  correctly and completely.  Before you start the TRANSMIT command, you
  must put the other computer in data collection mode, for example by
  starting a text editor.  TRANSMIT may be interrupted by Ctrl-C.  Synonym:
  XMIT.  See HELP SET TRANSMIT for further information.
```

### TYPE

Synonyms: REPLAY, REP

```
Syntax: TYPE [ switches... ] file
  Displays a file on the screen.  Pauses automatically at end of each
  screenful if COMMAND MORE-PROMPTING is ON.  Optional switches:
 
  /PAGE
     Pause at the end of each screenful even if COMMAND MORE-PROMPTING OFF.
     Synonym: /MORE
  /NOPAGE
     Don't pause at the end of each screen even if COMMAND MORE-PROMPTING ON.
  /HEAD:n
     Only type the first 'n' lines of the file.
  /TAIL:n
     Only type the last 'n' lines of the file.
  /MATCH:pattern
     Only type lines that match the given pattern.  HELP WILDCARDS for info
     info about patterns.  /HEAD and /TAIL apply after /MATCH.
  /PREFIX:string
     Print the given string at the beginning of each line.
  /NUMBER
     Add line numbers (conflicts with /PREFIX)
  /WIDTH:number
     Truncate each line at the given column number before printing.
  /COUNT
     Count lines (and matches) and print the count(s) but not the lines.
  /CHARACTER-SET:name
     Translates from the named character set.
  /TRANSLATE-TO:name
     Translates to the named character set (default = current file charset).
  /TRANSPARENT
     Inhibits character-set translation.
  /INTERPRET
     Shows the file with Kermit backslash escapes interpreted.
  /OUTPUT:name
     Sends results to the given file.  If this switch is omitted, the
     results appear on your screen.  This switch overrides any express or
     implied /PAGE switch.
 
You can use SET OPTIONS TYPE to set the defaults for /PAGE or /NOPAGE and
/WIDTH.  Use SHOW OPTIONS to see current TYPE options.

```

### WAIT

```
Syntax: WAIT { number-of-seconds, hh:mm:ss } [ <what> ]
 
Examples:
  wait 5 cd cts
  wait 23:59:59 cd
 
  Waits up to the given number of seconds or the given time of day for the
  specified item or event, which can be FILE, the name(s) of one or more
  modem signals, or nothing.  If nothing is specified, WAIT acts like SLEEP.
  If one or more modem signal names are given, Kermit waits for the specified
  modem signals to appear on the serial communication device.
  Sets FAILURE if the signals do not appear in the given time or interrupted
  from the keyboard during the waiting period.
 
Signals:
  cd  = Carrier Detect;
  dsr = Dataset Ready;
  cts = Clear To Send;
  ri  = Ring Indicate.
 
If you want Kermit to wait for a file event, then the syntax is:
 
  WAIT <time> FILE { CREATION, DELETION, MODIFICATION } <filename>
 
where <time> is as above, and <filename> is the name of a single file.
Kermit waits up to the given amount of time for the specified event to occur
with the specified file, succeeds if it does, fails if it doesn't.
```

### WDIRECTORY

  commandlist while the condition is true.  Conditions are the same as for
  IF commands.
```

### WHO

```
Syntax: WHO [ user ]
Displays info about the user.
```

### WILDCARDS

```
A "wildcard" is a notation used in a filename to match multiple files.
For example, in "send *.txt" the asterisk is a wildcard.  Kermit commands
that accept filenames also accepts wildcards, except commands that are
allowed to operate on only one file, such as TRANSMIT.
This version of Kermit accepts the following wildcards:
 
* Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.  For example, "ck*.c"
  matches all files whose names start with "ck" and end with ".c"
  including "ck.c".
 
? Matches any single character.  For example, "ck?.c" matches all files
  whose names are exactly 5 characters long and start with "ck" and end
  with ".c".  When typing commands at the prompt, you must precede any
  question mark to be used for matching by a backslash (\) to override the
  normal function of question mark in interactive commands, which is to
  provide menus and file lists.  You don't, however, need to quote filename
  question marks in command files (script programs).
 
[abc]
  Square brackets enclosing a list of characters matches any character in
  the list.  Example: ckuusr.[ch] matches ckuusr.c and ckuusr.h.
 
[a-z]
  Square brackets enclosing a range of characters matches any character in
  the range; a hyphen (-) separates the low and high elements of the range.
  For example, [a-z] matches any character from a to z.
 
[acdm-z]
  Lists and ranges may be combined.  This example matches a, c, d, or any
  letter from m through z.
 
{string1,string2,...}
  Braces enclose a list of strings to be matched.  For example:
  ck{ufio,vcon,cmai}.c matches ckufio.c, ckvcon.c, or ckcmai.c.  The strings
  may themselves contain *, ?, [abc], [a-z], or other lists of strings.
 
To force a special pattern character to be taken literally, precede it with
a backslash, e.g. [a\-z] matches a, hyphen, or z rather than a through z.
Or tell Kermit to SET WILDCARD-EXPANSION OFF before entering or referring
to the filename.
 
Similar notation can be used in general-purpose string matching.  Type HELP
PATTERNS for details.  Also see HELP SET MATCH.

Synatx: SET AUTHENTICATION <auth_type> <parameter> <value>
  Sets defaults for the AUTHENTICATE command:
 
In all of the following commands "SSL" and "TLS" are aliases.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } CIPHER-LIST <list of ciphers>
Applies to both SSL and TLS.  A colon separated list of any of the following

                a subsequent list entry)
    "!"         kill cipher from the list (it may not be added again
                by a subsequent list entry)
 
If no modifier is specified the entry is added to the list at the current 
position.  "+" may also be used to combine tags to specify entries such as 
"RSA+RC4" describes all ciphers that use both RSA and RC4.
 
For example, all available ciphers not including ADH key exchange:
 
  ALL:!ADH:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP

  HIGH:MEDIUM:LOW:EXPORT56:EXP:ADH:!kRSA:!aRSA:!RC4:!RC2:!IDEA
 
The OpenSSL command 
 
  openssl.exe ciphers -v <list of ciphers> 
 
may be used to list all of the ciphers and the order described by a specific
<list of ciphers>.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } CRL-DIR <directory>
specifies a directory that contains certificate revocation files where each
file is named by the hash of the certificate that has been revoked.
 
  OpenSSL expects the hash symlinks to be made like this:
 
    ln -s crl.pem `openssl crl -hash -noout -in crl.pem`.r0
 
  Since not all file systems have symlinks you can use the following command
  in Kermit to copy the crl.pem file to the hash file name.
 
     copy crl.pem {\fcommand(openssl.exe crl -hash -noout -in crl.pem).r0}
 
  This produces a hash based on the issuer field in the CRL such 
  that the issuer field of a Cert may be quickly mapped to the 
  correct CRL.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } CRL-FILE <filename>
specifies a file that contains a list of certificate revocations.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } DEBUG { ON, OFF }
specifies whether debug information should be displayed about the SSL/TLS
connection.  When DEBUG is ON, the VERIFY command does not terminate
connections when set to FAIL-IF-NO-PEER-CERT when a certificate is
presented that cannot be successfully verified.  Instead each error
is displayed but the connection automatically continues.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } DH-PARAM-FILE <filename>
  Specifies a file containing DH parameters which are used to generate
  temporary DH keys.  If a DH parameter file is not provided Kermit uses a
  fixed set of parameters depending on the negotiated key length.  Kermit
  provides DH parameters for key lengths of 512, 768, 1024, 1536, and 2048
  bits.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } DSA-CERT-CHAIN-FILE <filename>
  Specifies a file containing a DSA certificate chain to be sent along with
  the DSA-CERT to the peer.  This file must only be specified if Kermit is
  being used as a server and the DSA certificate was signed by an
  intermediary certificate authority.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } DSA-CERT-FILE <filename>
  Specifies a file containing a DSA certificate to be sent to the peer to 
  authenticate the host or end user.  The file may contain the matching DH 
  private key instead of using the DSA-KEY-FILE command.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } DSA-KEY-FILE <filename>
Specifies a file containing the private DH key that matches the DSA 
certificate specified with DSA-CERT-FILE.  This command is only necessary if
the private key is not appended to the certificate in the file specified by
DSA-CERT-FILE.
 
  Note: When executing a script in the background or when it is
  running as an Internet Kermit Service Daemon, Kermit cannot support 
  encrypted private keys.  When attempting to load a private key that is
  encrypted, a prompt will be generated requesting the passphrase necessary
  to decrypt the keyfile.  To automate access to the private key you must
  decrypt the encrypted keyfile and create an unencrypted keyfile for use
  by Kermit.  This can be accomplished by using the following command and
  the passphrase:
 
  openssl dsa -in <encrypted-key-file> -out <unencrypted-key-file>
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } RANDOM-FILE <filename>
  Specifies a file containing random data to be used as seed for the
  Pseudo Random Number Generator.  The contents of the file are
  overwritten with new random data on each use.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } RSA-CERT-CHAIN-FILE <filename>
  Specifies a file containing a RSA certificate chain to be sent along with
  the RSA-CERT to the peer.  This file must only be specified if Kermit is
  being used as a server and the RSA certificate was signed by an
  intermediary certificate authority.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } RSA-CERT-FILE <filename>
  Specifies a file containing a RSA certificate to be sent to the peer to 
  authenticate the host or end user.  The file may contain the matching RSA 
  private key instead of using the RSA-KEY-FILE command.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } RSA-KEY-FILE <filename>
  Specifies a file containing the private RSA key that matches the RSA
  certificate specified with RSA-CERT-FILE.  This command is only necessary
  if the private key is not appended to the certificate in the file specified
  by RSA-CERT-FILE.  
 
  Note: When executing a script in the background or when it is
  running as an Internet Kermit Service Daemon, Kermit cannot support 
  encrypted private keys.  When attempting to load a private key that is
  encrypted, a prompt will be generated requesting the passphrase necessary
  to decrypt the keyfile.  To automate access to the private key you must
  decrypt the encrypted keyfile and create an unencrypted keyfile for use
  by Kermit.  This can be accomplished by using the following command and
  the passphrase:
 
  openssl rsa -in <encrypted-key-file> -out <unencrypted-key-file>
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } VERBOSE { ON, OFF }
  Specifies whether information about the authentication (ie, the
  certificate chain) should be displayed upon making a connection.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } VERIFY { NO,PEER-CERT,FAIL-IF-NO-PEER-CERT }
  Specifies whether certificates should be requested from the peer verified;
  whether they should be verified when they are presented; and whether they
  should be required.  When set to NO (the default for IKSD), Kermit does
  not request that the peer send a certificate; if one is presented it is
  ignored.  When set to PEER-CERT (the default when not IKSD), Kermit
  requests a certificate be sent by the peer.  If presented, the certificate
  is verified.  Any errors during the verification process result in
  queries to the end user.  When set to FAIL-IF-NO-PEER-CERT, Kermit
  requests a certificate be sent by the peer.  If the certificate is not
  presented or fails to verify, the connection is terminated without
  querying the user.
 
  If an anonymous cipher (i.e., ADH) is desired, the NO setting must be
  used.  Otherwise, the receipt of the peer certificate request is
  interpreted as a protocol error and the negotiation fails.
 
  If you wish to allow the peer to authenticate using either an X509
  certificate to userid mapping function or via use of a ~/.tlslogin file
  you must use either PEER-CERT or FAIL-IF-NO-PEER-CERT.  Otherwise, any
  certificates that are presented is ignored.  In other words, use NO if you
  want to disable the ability to use certificates to authenticate a peer.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } VERIFY-DIR <directory>
  Specifies a directory that contains root CA certificate files used to
  verify the certificate chains presented by the peer.  Each file is named
  by a hash of the certificate.
 
  OpenSSL expects the hash symlinks to be made like this:
 
    ln -s cert.pem `openssl x509 -hash -noout -in cert.pem`.0
 
  Since not all file systems have symlinks you can use the following command
  in Kermit to copy the cert.pem file to the hash file name.
 
    copy cert.pem {\fcommand(openssl.exe x509 -hash -noout -in cert.pem).0}
 
  This produces a hash based on the subject field in the cert such that the
  certificate may be quickly found.
 
SET AUTHENTICATION { SSL, TLS } VERIFY-FILE <file>
  Specifies a file that contains root CA certificates to be used for
  verifying certificate chains.

### SET BACKGROUND

Synonyms: B, BA, BATCH

```
Syntax: SET BACKGROUND { OFF, ON }
 
  SET BACKGROUND OFF forces prompts and messages to appear on your screen
  even though Kermit thinks it is running in the background.
```

### SET B

Synonym for [SET BACKGROUND](#set-background).

### SET BA

Synonym for [SET BACKGROUND](#set-background).

### SET BATCH

Synonym for [SET BACKGROUND](#set-background).

### SET SPEED

Synonym: BAUD

```
Syntax: SET SPEED number
  Speed for serial-port communication device specified in most recent
  SET LINE command, in bits per second.  Type SET SPEED ? for a list of
  possible speeds.  Some of the speeds shown might not be supported on the
  computer you are using.  Has no effect on job's controlling terminal.
```

### SET BAUD

Synonym for [SET SPEED](#set-speed).

### SET BELL

```
Syntax: SET BELL { OFF, ON }
  ON (the default) enables ringing of the terminal bell (beep) except where
  it is disabled in certain circumstances, e.g. by SET TRANSFER BELL.  OFF
  disables ringing of the bell in all circumstances, overriding any specific
  SET xxx BELL selections.
```

### SET BLOCK-CHECK

```
Syntax: SET BLOCK-CHECK number
 
Type of block check to be used for error detection on file-transfer
packets: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  This command must be given to the file
sender prior to the transfer.
 
Type 1 is standard and supported by all Kermit protocol implementations,
  but it's only a 6-bit checksum, represented in a single printable ASCII
  character.  It's fine for reliable connections (error-correcting modems,
  TCP/IP, etc) but type 3 is recommended for connections where errors can
  occur.
 
Type 2 is a 12-bit checksum represented in two printable characters.
 
Type 3 is a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check, the strongest error
  detection method supported by Kermit protocol, represented in three
  printable characters.
 
Type 4 (alias "BLANK-FREE-2") is a 12-bit checksum guaranteed to
  contain no blanks in its representation; this is needed for connections
  where trailing blanks are stripped from incoming lines of text.
 
Type 5 (alias "FORCE-3") means to force a Type 3 block check on
  every packet, including the first packet, which normally has a type 1
  block check.  This is for use in critical applications on noisy
  connections.  As with types 2, 3, and 4, if the Kermit file
  transfer partner does not support this type, the transfer fails
  immediately at the beginning of the transfer.
```

### SET BROWSER

```
Syntax: SET BROWSER [ pathname [ options ] ]
  Specifies the name of your preferred browser plus any command-line
  options.  SHOW BROWSER displays it.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW BROWSER`:

```
 browser: (none)
```

### SET BUFFERS

```
Syntax: SET BUFFERS n1 [ n2 ]
 
  Changes the overall amount of memory allocated for SEND and RECEIVE packet
  buffers, respectively.  Bigger numbers let you have longer packets and
  more window slots.  If n2 is omitted, the same value as n1 is used.
 
  NOTE: This command is not needed in this version of Kermit, which is
  already configured for maximum-size packet buffers.
```

### SET CARRIER-WATCH

```
Syntax: SET CARRIER-WATCH { AUTO, OFF, ON }
 
  Attempts to control treatment of carrier (the Data Carrier Detect signal)
  on serial communication (SET LINE or SET PORT) devices.  ON means that
  carrier is required at all times.  OFF means carrier is never required.
  AUTO (the default) means carrier is required at all times except during
  the DIAL command.  Correct operation of carrier-watch depends on the
  capabilities of the underlying OS, drivers, devices, and cables.  If you
  need to CONNECT to a serial device that is not asserting carrier, and
  Kermit won't let you, use SET CARRIER-WATCH OFF.  Use SHOW COMMUNICATIONS
  to display the CARRIER-WATCH setting.
```

### SET CASE

```
Syntax: SET CASE { ON, OFF }
  Tells whether alphabetic case is significant in string comparisons
  done by INPUT, IF, and other commands.  This setting is local to the
  current macro or command file, and inherited by subordinates.
```

### SET CD

```
Syntax: SET CD { HOME <path>, PATH <path>, MESSAGE { ON, OFF, FILE <list> } }
 
SET CD HOME <path>
  Specified which directory to change to if CD or KCD is given without a
  pathname.  If this command is not given, your login or HOME directory is
  used.
 
SET CD PATH <path>
  Overrides normal CDPATH environment variable, which tells the CD command
  where to look for directories to CD to if you don't specify them fully.
  The format is:
 
    set cd path :directory:directory:...
 
  in other words, a list of directories separated by colons, with a colon
  at the beginning, e.g.:
 
    set cd path :/usr/olga:/usr/ivan/public:/tmp
 
SET CD MESSAGE { ON, OFF }
  Default is OFF.  When ON, this tells Kermit to look for a file with a
  certain name in any directory that you CD to, and if it finds one, to
  display it on your screen when you give the CD command.  The filename,
  or list of names, is given in the SET CD MESSAGE FILE command.
 
SET CD MESSAGE FILE name
  or:
SET CD MESSAGE FILE {{name1}{name2}...{name8}}
  Specify up to 8 filenames to look for when when CDing to a new directory
  and CD MESSAGE is ON.  The first one found, if any, in the new directory
  is displayed.  The default list is:
 
   {{./.readme}{README.TXT}{READ.ME}}
 
Synonym: SET SERVER CD-MESSAGE FILE.
 
Type SHOW CD to view current CD settings.  Also see HELP SET SERVER.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW CD`:

```
 current directory:  /home/jgoerzen/tree/ckermit
 previous directory: (none)
 cd home:            /home/jgoerzen/
 cd path:            (none)
 cd message:         off
 server cd-message:  off
 cd message file:    {{./.readme}{README.TXT}{READ.ME}}
```

### SET CLEAR-CHANNEL

Synonyms: CL, CLE, CLEA, CLEAR, CLEARCHANNEL

```
Syntax: SET CLEAR-CHANNEL { ON, OFF, AUTO }
  Tells Kermit whether its connection is transparent to all 8-bit bytes.
  Default is AUTO, meaning Kermit figures it out from the connection type.
  When both sender and receiver agree channel is clear, SET PREFIXING NONE
  is used automatically.
```

### SET CL

Synonym for [SET CLEAR-CHANNEL](#set-clear-channel).

### SET CLE

Synonym for [SET DISCONNECT](#set-disconnect).

### SET COMMAND

Synonyms: CMD, CONSOLE

```
Syntax: SET COMMAND parameter value
 
SET COMMAND AUTODOWNLOAD { ON, OFF }
  Enables/Disables automatic recognition of Kermit packets while in
  command mode.  ON by default.
 
SET COMMAND BYTESIZE { 7, 8 }
  Informs Kermit of the bytesize of the communication path between itself
  and your keyboard and screen.  8 is assumed.  SET COMMAND BYTE 7 only if
  8-bit characters cannot pass.
 
SET COMMAND ERROR { 0,1,2,3 }
  Sets the verbosity level of command error messages; the higher the number,
  the more verbose the message.  The default is 1.  Higher values are
  useful only for debugging scripts.
 
SET COMMAND HEIGHT <number>
  Informs Kermit of the number of rows in your command screen for the
  purposes of More?-prompting.
 
SET COMMAND WIDTH <number>
  Informs Kermit of the number of characters across your screen for
  purposes of screen formatting.
 
SET COMMAND MORE-PROMPTING { ON, OFF }
  ON (the default) enables More?-prompting when Kermit needs to display
  text that does not fit vertically on your screen.  OFF allows the text to
  scroll by without intervention.  If your command window has scroll bars,
  you might prefer OFF.
 
SET COMMAND RECALL-BUFFER-SIZE number
  How big you want Kermit's command recall buffer to be.  By default, it
  holds 10 commands.  You can make it any size you like, subject to memory
  constraints of the computer.  A size of 0 disables command recall.
  Whenever you give this command, previous command history is lost.
 
SET COMMAND QUOTING { ON, OFF }
  Whether to treat backslash and question mark as special characters (ON),
  or as ordinary data characters (OFF) in commands.  ON by default.
 
SET COMMAND DOUBLEQUOTING { ON, OFF }
  Whether to allow doublequotes (") to be used to enclose fields,
  filenames, directory names, and macro arguments that might contain
  spaces.  ON by default; use OFF to force compatibility with older
  versions.
 
SET COMMAND RETRY { ON, OFF }
  Whether to reprompt you with the correct but incomplete portion of a
  syntactically incorrect command.  ON by default.
 
Use SHOW COMMAND to display these settings.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW COMMAND`:

```
 Command autodownload: on

### SET COMPATIBILITY

```
Syntax: SET COMPATIBILITY { 9, 10, 11, DEFAULT }
 
Reconfigures a fixed set of other SET and ENABLE settings to match
the defaults of an earlier C-Kermit release, or restores the current
C-Kermit 11 defaults.  This changes settings only; it adds no new
behavior beyond what those settings already control.  Since those
versions didn't support IPv6, settings for 9 and 10 also disable IPv6.
 
  9        Match C-Kermit 9.0.302 (2011).
  10       Match C-Kermit 10.0 Beta.12 (2025).
  11       Restore the C-Kermit 11 (current) defaults.  DEFAULT is
           a synonym for this.
 
Settings affected: SET FILE COLLISION, SET TRANSFER MODE, SET
TERMINAL AUTODOWNLOAD ERROR, SET RECEIVE CONFIRM, SET TCP
ADDRESS-FAMILY, SET RECEIVE PATHNAMES. Also, ENABLE/DISABLE for CD,
COPY, DIRECTORY, ENABLE, FINISH, GET, MKDIR, RENAME, SEND, SET,
SPACE, TYPE, WHO, ASSIGN, QUERY, MAIL, and PRINT.
 
SET COMPATIBILITY 9 and SET COMPATIBILITY 10 weaken settings that
C-Kermit 11 tightened for security.  Use them only when
interoperating with old scripts or expectations that require this,
not routinely, and not on a connection to an untrusted peer.
```

### SET CONTROL-CHARACTER

Synonym: CON

```
Syntax: SET CONTROL-CHARACTER { PREFIXED, UNPREFIXED } { <code>..., ALL }
 
  <code> is the numeric ASCII code for a control character 1-31,127-159,255.
  The word "ALL" means all characters in this range.
 
  PREFIXED <code> means the given control character must be converted to a
  printable character and prefixed, the default for all control characters.
 
  UNPREFIXED <code> means you think it is safe to send the given control
  character as-is, without a prefix.  USE THIS OPTION AT YOUR OWN RISK!
 
  SHOW CONTROL to see current settings.  SET CONTROL PREFIXED ALL is
  recommended for safety.  You can include multiple <code> values in one
  command, separated by spaces.
```

### SET CON

Synonym for [SET CONTROL-CHARACTER](#set-control-character).

### SET COUNT

SET DEBUG MESSAGES { ON, OFF, STDERR } [C-Kermit 9.0]
  Enables/Disables messages printed by the DEBUG command.
  SET DEBUG OFF causes DEBUG messages not to be printed.
  SET DEBUG ON sends DEBUG messages to standard output (stdout);
  SET DEBUG STDERR sends DEBUG messages to standard error (stderr);
```

### SET DEFAULT

### SET DIAL

Synonyms: DI, DIA

```
The SET DIAL command establishes or changes all parameters related to
dialing the telephone.  Also see HELP DIAL and HELP SET MODEM.  Use SHOW
DIAL to display all of the SET DIAL values.
 
SET DIAL COUNTRY-CODE <number>
  Tells Kermit the telephonic country-code of the country you are dialing
  from, so it can tell whether a portable-format phone number from your
  dialing directory will result in a national or an international call.
  Examples: 1 for USA, Canada, Puerto Rico, etc; 7 for Russia, 39 for Italy,
  351 for Portugal, 47 for Norway, 44 for the UK, 972 for Israel, 81 for
  Japan, ...
 
  If you have not already set your DIAL INTL-PREFIX and LD-PREFIX, then this
  command sets default values for them: 011 and 1, respectively, for country
  code 1; 00 and 0, respectively, for all other country codes.  If these are
  not your true international and long-distance dialing prefixes, then you
  should follow this command by DIAL INTL-PREFIX and LD-PREFIX to let Kermit
  know what they really are.
 
SET DIAL AREA-CODE [ <number> ]
  Tells Kermit the area or city code that you are dialing from, so it can
  tell whether a portable-format phone number from the dialing directory is
  local or long distance.  Be careful not to include your long-distance
  dialing prefix as part of your area code; for example, the area code for
  central London is 171, not 0171.
 
SET DIAL CONFIRMATION {ON, OFF}
  Kermit does various transformations on a telephone number retrieved from
  the dialing directory prior to dialing (use LOOKUP <name> to see them).
  In case the result might be wrong, you can use SET DIAL CONFIRM ON to have
  Kermit ask you if it is OK to dial the number, and if not, to let you type
  in a replacement.
 
SET DIAL CONNECT { AUTO, ON, OFF }
  Whether to CONNECT (enter terminal mode) automatically after successfully
  dialing.  ON means to do this; OFF means not to.  AUTO (the default) means
  do it if the DIAL command was given interactively, but don't do it if the
  DIAL command was issued from a macro or command file.  If you specify ON
  or AUTO, you may follow this by one of the keywords VERBOSE or QUIET, to
  indicate whether the verbose 4-line 'Connecting...' message is to be
  displayed if DIAL succeeds and Kermit goes into CONNECT mode.
 
SET DIAL CONVERT-DIRECTORY {ASK, ON, OFF}
  The format of Kermit's dialing directory changed in version 5A(192).  This
  command tells Kermit what to do when it encounters an old-style directory:
  ASK you whether to convert it, or convert it automatically (ON), or leave
  it alone (OFF).  Old-style directories can still be used without
  conversion, but the parity and speed fields are ignored.
 
SET DIAL DIRECTORY [ filename [ filename [ filename [ ... ] ] ] ]
  The name(s) of your dialing directory file(s).  If you do not supply any
  filenames, the  dialing directory feature is disabled and all numbers are
  dialed literally as given in the DIAL command.  If you supply more than
  one directory, all of them are searched.
 
SET DIAL SORT {ON, OFF}
  When multiple entries are obtained from your dialing directory, they are
  sorted in "cheapest-first" order.  If this does not produce the desired
  effect, SET DIAL SORT OFF to disable sorting, and the numbers will be
  dialed in the order in which they were found.
 
SET DIAL DISPLAY {ON, OFF}
  Whether to display dialing progress on the screen; default is OFF.
 
SET DIAL HANGUP {ON, OFF}
  Whether to hang up the phone prior to dialing; default is ON.
 
SET DIAL IGNORE-DIALTONE {ON, OFF}
  Whether to ignore dialtone when dialing; default is OFF.
 
SET DIAL MACRO [ name ]
  Specify the name of a macro to execute on every phone number dialed, just
  prior to dialing it, in order to perform any last-minute alterations.
 
SET DIAL METHOD {AUTO, DEFAULT, TONE, PULSE}
  Whether to use the modem's DEFAULT dialing method, or to force TONE or
  PULSE dialing.  AUTO (the default) means to choose tone or pulse dialing
  based on the country code.  (Also see SET DIAL TONE-COUNTRIES and SET DIAL
  PULSE-COUNTRIES.)
 
SET DIAL PACING number
  How many milliseconds to pause between sending each character to the modem
  dialer.  The default is -1, meaning to use the number from the built-in
 modem database.
  
SET DIAL PULSE-COUNTRIES [ cc [ cc [ ... ] ] ]
  Sets the list of countries in which pulse dialing is required.  Each cc
  is a country code.
 
SET DIAL TEST { ON, OFF }
  OFF for normal dialing.  Set to ON to test dialing procedures without
  actually dialing.
 
SET DIAL TONE-COUNTRIES [ cc [ cc [ ... ] ] ]
  Sets the list of countries in which tone dialing is available.  Each cc
  is a country code.
 
SET DIAL TIMEOUT number
  How many seconds to wait for a dialed call to complete.  Use this command
  to override the DIAL command's automatic timeout calculation.  A value
  of 0 turns off this feature and returns to Kermit's automatic dial
  timeout calculation.
 
SET DIAL RESTRICT { INTERNATIONAL, LOCAL, LONG-DISTANCE, NONE }
  Prevents placing calls of the type indicated, or greater.  For example
  SET DIAL RESTRICT LONG prevents placing of long-distance and international
  calls.  If this command is not given, there are no restrictions.  Useful
  when dialing a list of numbers fetched from a dialing directory.
 
SET DIAL RETRIES <number>
  How many times to redial each number if the dialing result is busy or no
  no answer, until the call is successfully answered.  The default is 0
  because automatic redialing is illegal in some countries.
 
SET DIAL INTERVAL <number>
  How many seconds to pause between automatic redial attempts; default 10.
 
The following commands apply to all phone numbers, whether given literally
or found in the dialing directory:
 
SET DIAL PREFIX [ text ]
  Establish a prefix to be applied to all phone numbers that are dialed,
  for example to disable call waiting.
 
SET DIAL SUFFIX [ text ]
  Establish a suffix to be added after all phone numbers that are dialed.
 
The following commands apply only to portable-format numbers obtained from
the dialing directory; i.e. numbers that start with a "+" sign and
country code, followed by area code in parentheses, followed by the phone
number.
 
SET DIAL LC-AREA-CODES [ <list> ]
  Species a list of area codes to which dialing is local, i.e. does not
  require the LD-PREFIX.  Up to 32 area codes may be listed, separated by
  spaces.  Any area codes in this list will be included in the final dial
  string so do not include your own area code if it should not be dialed.
 
SET DIAL LC-PREFIX [ <text> ]
  Specifies a prefix to be applied to local calls made from portable dialing
  directory entries.  Normally no prefix is used for local calls.
 
SET DIAL LC-SUFFIX [ <text> ]
  Specifies a suffix to be applied to local calls made from portable dialing
  directory entries.  Normally no suffix is used for local calls.
 
SET DIAL LD-PREFIX [ <text> ]
  Your long-distance dialing prefix, to be used with portable dialing
  directory entries that result in long-distance calls.
 
SET DIAL LD-SUFFIX [ <text> ]
  Long-distance dialing suffix, if any, to be used with portable dialing
  directory entries that result in long-distance calls.  This would normally
  be used for appending a calling-card number to the phone number.
 
SET DIAL FORCE-LONG-DISTANCE { ON, OFF }
  Whether to force long-distance dialing for calls that normally would be
  local.  For use (e.g.) in France.
 
SET DIAL TOLL-FREE-AREA-CODE [ <number> [ <number> [ ... ] ] ]
  Tells Kermit the toll-free area code(s) in your country.
 
SET DIAL TOLL-FREE-PREFIX [ <text> ]
  You toll-free dialing prefix, in case it is different from your long-
  distance dialing prefix.
 
SET DIAL INTL-PREFIX <text>
  Your international dialing prefix, to be used with portable dialing
  directory entries that result in international calls.
 
SET DIAL INTL-SUFFIX <text>
  International dialing suffix, if any, to be used with portable dialing
  directory entries that result in international calls.
 
SET DIAL PBX-OUTSIDE-PREFIX <text>
  Use this to tell Kermit how to get an outside line when dialing from a
  Private Branch Exchange (PBX).
 
SET DIAL PBX-EXCHANGE <text> [ <text> [ ... ] ]
  If PBX-OUTSIDE-PREFIX is set, then you can use this command to tell Kermit
  the leading digits of one or more local phone numbers that identify it as
  being on your PBX, so it can make an internal call by deleting those digits
  from the phone number.
 
SET DIAL PBX-INTERNAL-PREFIX <text>
  If PBX-EXCHANGE is set, and Kermit determines from it that a call is
  internal, then this prefix, if any, is added to the number prior to
  dialing.  Use this if internal calls from your PBX require a special prefix.

letter or one of: @, ^, _, [, \, or ], to indicate a control character;
for example, SET ESC ^_ sets your escape character to Ctrl-Underscore.
 
You can also specify an 8-bit character (128-255) as your escape character,
either by typing it literally or by entering its numeric code.

### SET EVALUATE

```
Not available - "help set evaluate"
```

### SET EXIT

```
Syntax: SET EXIT HANGUP { ON, OFF }
  When ON (which is the default), C-Kermit executes an implicit HANGUP and
  CLOSE command on the communications device or connection when it exits.
  When OFF, Kermit skips this sequence.
 
Syntax: SET EXIT MESSAGE { ON, OFF, STDERR }
  Allows the text (if any) from an EXIT command (see HELP EXIT) to be
  supressed (OFF), printed normally (ON, the default), or sent to STDERR.
 
Syntax: SET EXIT ON-DISCONNECT { ON, OFF }
  When ON, C-Kermit EXITs automatically when a network connection
  is terminated either by the host or by issuing a HANGUP command.
 
Syntax: SET EXIT STATUS number
  Set C-Kermit's program return code to the given number, which can be a
  constant, variable, function result, or arithmetic expression.
 
Syntax: SET EXIT WARNING { ON, OFF, ALWAYS }
  When EXIT WARNING is ON, issue a warning message and ask for confirmation
  before EXITing if a connection to another computer might still be open.
  When EXIT WARNING is ALWAYS, confirmation is always requested.  When OFF
  it is never requested.  The default is ON.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW EXIT`:

```
 Exit warning on
 Exit message: on
 Exit on-disconnect: off
 Exit hangup: on
 Current exit status: 0

### SET FILE

```
Syntax: SET FILE parameter value
 
Sets file-related parameters.  Use SHOW FILE to view them.  Also see SET
(and SHOW) TRANSFER and PROTOCOL.
 
SET FILE TYPE { TEXT, BINARY }
  How file contents are to be treated during file transfer in the absence
  of any other indication.  TYPE can be TEXT for conversion of record format
  and character set, which is usually needed when transferring text files
  between unlike platforms (such as UNIX and Windows), or BINARY for no
  conversion if TRANSFER MODE is MANUAL, which is not the default.  Use
  BINARY with TRANSFER MODE MANUAL for executable programs or binary data or
  whenever you wish to duplicate the original contents of the file, byte for
  byte.  In most modern Kermit programs, the file sender informs the receiver
  of the file type automatically.  However, when sending files from C-Kermit
  to an ancient or non-Columbia Kermit implementation, you might need to set
  the corresponding file type at the receiver as well.
 
  When TRANSFER MODE is AUTOMATIC (as it is by default), various automatic
  methods (depending on the platform) are used to determine whether a file
  is transferred in text or binary mode; these methods (which might include
  content scan (see SET FILE SCAN below), filename pattern matching (SET FILE
  PATTERNS), client/server "kindred-spirit" recognition, or source file
  record format) supersede the FILE TYPE setting but can, themselves, be
  superseded by including a /BINARY or /TEXT switch in the SEND, GET, or
  RECEIVE command.
 
  When TRANSFER MODE is MANUAL, the automatic methods are skipped for sending
  files; the FILE TYPE setting is used instead, which can be superseded on
  a per-command basis with a /TEXT or /BINARY switch.
 
SET FILE BYTESIZE { 7, 8 }
  Normally 8.  If 7, Kermit truncates the 8th bit of all file bytes.
 
SET FILE CHARACTER-SET name
  Tells the encoding of the local file, ASCII by default.
  The names ITALIAN, PORTUGUESE, NORWEGIAN, etc, refer to 7-bit ISO-646
  national character sets.  LATIN1 is the 8-bit ISO 8859-1 Latin Alphabet 1
  for Western European languages.
  NEXT is the 8-bit character set of the NeXT workstation.
  The CPnnn sets are for PCs.  MACINTOSH-LATIN is for the Macintosh.
  LATIN2 is ISO 8859-2 for Eastern European languages that are written with
  Roman letters.  Mazovia is a PC code page used in Poland.
  KOI-CYRILLIC, CYRILLIC-ISO, and CP866 are 8-bit Cyrillic character sets.
  SHORT-KOI is a 7-bit ASCII coding for Cyrillic.  BULGARIA-PC is a PC code
  page used in Bulgaria
  HEBREW-ISO is ISO 8859-8 Latin/Hebrew.  CP862 is the Hebrew PC code page.
  HEBREW-7 is like ASCII with the lowercase letters replaced by Hebrew.
  GREEK-ISO is ISO 8859-7 Latin/Greek.  CP869 is the Greek PC code page.
  ELOT-927 is like ASCII with the lowercase letters replaced by Greek.
  JAPANESE-EUC, JIS7-KANJI, DEC-KANJI, and SHIFT-JIS-KANJI are Japanese
  Kanji character sets.
  UCS-2 is the 2-byte form of the Universal Character Set.
  UTF-8 is the serialized form of the Universal Character Set.
  Type SET FILE CHAR ? for a complete list of file character sets.
 
SET FILE DEFAULT 7BIT-CHARACTER-SET
  When automatically switching among different kinds of files while sending
  this tells the character set to be used for 7-bit text files.
 
SET FILE DEFAULT 8BIT-CHARACTER-SET
  This tells the character set to be used for 8-bit text files when
  switching automatically among different kinds of files.
 
SET FILE COLLISION option
  Tells what to do when a file arrives that has the same name as
  an existing file.  The options are:
   BACKUP - Rename the old file to a new, unique name and store
     the incoming file under the name it was sent with.
   OVERWRITE - Overwrite (replace) the existing file; doesn't work for
     a Kermit server unless you also tell it to ENABLE DELETE.
   APPEND - Append the incoming file to the end of the existing file.
   REJECT (default) - Refuse and/or discard the incoming file (= DISCARD).
   RENAME - Give the incoming file a unique name.
   UPDATE - Accept the incoming file only if newer than the existing file.
 
SET FILE DESTINATION { DISK, PRINTER, SCREEN, NOWHERE }
  DISK (default): Store incoming files on disk.
  PRINTER:        Send incoming files to SET PRINTER device.
  SCREEN:         Display incoming files on screen (local mode only).
  NOWHERE:        Do not put incoming files anywhere (use for calibration).
 
SET FILE DISPLAY option
  Selects the format of the file transfer display for local-mode file
  transfer.  The choices are:
 
  BRIEF      A line per file, showing size, mode, status, and throughput.
  SERIAL     One dot is printed for every K bytes transferred.
  CRT        Numbers are continuously updated on a single screen line.
             This format can be used on any video display terminal.
  FULLSCREEN A fully formatted 24x80 screen showing lots of information.
             This requires a terminal or terminal emulator.
  NONE       No file transfer display at all.
 
SET FILE DOWNLOAD-DIRECTORY [ <directory-name> ]
  The directory into which all received files should be placed.  By default,
  received files go into your current directory.
 
SET FILE EOF { CTRL-Z, LENGTH }
  End-Of-File detection method, normally LENGTH.  Applies only to text-mode
  transfers.  When set to CTRL-Z, this makes the file sender treat the first
  Ctrl-Z in the input file as the end of file (EOF), and it makes the file
  receiver tack a Ctrl-Z onto the end of the output file if it does not
  already end with Ctrl-Z.
 
SET FILE END-OF-LINE { CR, CRLF, LF }
  Use this command to specify nonstandard line terminators for text files.
 
SET FILE INCOMPLETE { AUTO, KEEP, DISCARD }
  What to do with an incompletely received file: KEEP, DISCARD, or AUTO.
  AUTO (the default) means DISCARD if transfer is in text mode, KEEP if it
  is in binary mode.
 
SET FILE LISTSIZE number
  Changes the size of the internal wildcard expansion list.  Use SHOW FILE
  to see the current size.  Use this command to increase the size if you get
  a "?Too many files" error.  Also see SET FILE STRINGSPACE.
 
SET FILE NAMES { CONVERTED, LITERAL }
  File names are normally CONVERTED to "common form" during transmission
  (e.g. lowercase to uppercase, extra periods changed to underscore, etc).
  LITERAL means use filenames literally (useful between like systems).  Also
  see SET SEND PATHNAMES and SET RECEIVE PATHNAMES.
 
SET FILE OUTPUT { { BUFFERED, UNBUFFERED } [ size ], BLOCKING, NONBLOCKING }
  Lets you control the disk output buffer for incoming files.  Buffered
  blocking writes are normal.  Nonblocking writes might be faster on some
  systems but might also be risky, depending on the underlying file service.
  Unbuffered writes might be useful in critical applications to ensure that
  cached disk writes are not lost in a crash, but will probably also be
  slower.  The optional size parameter after BUFFERED or UNBUFFERED lets you
  change the disk output buffer size; this might make a difference in
  performance.
 
SET FILE PATTERNS { ON, OFF, AUTO }
  ON means to use filename pattern lists to determine whether to send a file
  in text or binary mode.  OFF means to send all files in the prevailing
  mode.  AUTO (the default) is like ON if the other Kermit accepts Attribute
  packets and like OFF otherwise.  FILE PATTERNS are used only if FILE SCAN
  is OFF (see SET FILE SCAN).
 
SET FILE BINARY-PATTERNS [ <pattern> [ <pattern> ... ] ]
  Zero or more filename patterns which, if matched, cause a file to be sent
  in binary mode when FILE PATTERNS are ON.  HELP WILDCARDS for a description
  of pattern syntax.  SHOW PATTERNS to see the current file pattern lists.
 
SET FILE TEXT-PATTERNS [ <pattern> [ <pattern> ... ] ]
  Zero or more filename patterns which, if matched, cause a file to be sent
  in text mode when FILE PATTERNS is ON; if a file does not match a text or
  binary pattern, the prevailing SET FILE TYPE is used.
 
SET FILE SCAN { ON [ size ], OFF }
  If TRANSFER MODE is AUTOMATIC and FILE SCAN is ON (as it is by default)
  Kermit peeks at the file's contents to see if it's text or binary.  Use
  SET FILE SCAN OFF to disable file peeking, while still keeping TRANSFER
  MODE automatic to allow name patterns and other methods.  The optional
  size is the number of file bytes to scan, 49152 by default.  -1 means to
  scan the whole file.  Also see SET FILE PATTERNS.
 
SET FILE STRINGSPACE number
  Changes the size (in bytes) of the internal buffer that holds lists of
  filenames such as wildcard expansion lists.  Use SHOW FILE to see the
  current size.  Use this command to increase the size if you get a
  "?String space exhausted" error.  Also see SET FILE LISTSIZE.
 
SET FILE UCS BOM { ON, OFF }
  Whether to write a Byte Order Mark when creating a UCS-2 file.
 
SET FILE UCS BYTE-ORDER { BIG-ENDIAN, LITTLE-ENDIAN }
  Byte order to use when creating UCS-2 files, and to use when reading UCS-2
  files that do not start with a Byte Order Mark.
 
SET FILE SYSTEM-ID code
  Kermit system ID code to pretend to be. Valid options are:
    0:  anonymous       A1: Apple II      A3: Macintosh
    D7: VMS             DA: RSTS/E        DB: RT11
    F3: AOS/VS          I1: VM/CMS        I2: TSO
    I4: MUSIC           I7: CICS          I9: ROSCOE
    K2: Atari ST        L3: Amiga         MV: Stratus VOS
    N3: Aegis           U1: UNIX          U8: MS-DOS
    UD: OS-9            UN: MS-Windows    UO: OS/2
 
SET FILE WARNING { ON, OFF }
  SET FILE WARNING is superseded by the newer command, SET FILE
  COLLISION.  SET FILE WARNING ON is equivalent to SET FILE COLLISION RENAME
  and SET FILE WARNING OFF is equivalent to SET FILE COLLISION OVERWRITE.

### SET FLOW-CONTROL

Synonym: FL

```
Syntax: SET FLOW [ switch ] value
 
  Selects the type of flow control to use during file transfer, terminal
  connection, and script execution.
 
  Switches let you associate a particular kind of flow control with each
  kind of connection: /REMOTE, /MODEM, /DIRECT-SERIAL, /TCPIP, etc; type
  "set flow ?" for a list of available switches.  Then whenever you make
  a connection, the associated flow-control is chosen automatically.
  The flow-control values are NONE, KEEP, XON/XOFF, and possibly RTS/CTS
  and some others; again, type "set flow ?" for a list.  KEEP tells Kermit
  not to try to change the current flow-control method for the connection.
 
  If you omit the switch and simply supply a value, this value becomes the
  current flow control type, overriding any default value that might have
  been chosen in your most recent SET LINE, SET PORT, or SET HOST, or other
  connection-establishment command.
 
  Type SHOW FLOW-CONTROL to see the current defaults for each connection type
  as well as the current connection type and flow-control setting.  SHOW
  COMMUNICATIONS also shows the current flow-control setting.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW FLOW-CONTROL`:

```
Connection type:        remote
Current flow-control:   none
Switches automatically: yes

Defaults by connection type:
  remote        : none

### SET FT

Synonym for [SET FTP](#set-ftp).

### SET FTP-CLIENT

```
Syntax: SET FTP [ pathname [ options ] ]
  Specifies the name of your ftp client, plus any command-line options.
  SHOW FTP displays it.
```

### SET FUNCTION

```
SET FUNCTION DIAGNOSTICS { ON, OFF }
  Whether to issue diagnostic messages for illegal function calls and
  references to nonexistent built-in variables.  ON by default.
 
SET FUNCTION ERROR { ON, OFF }
  Whether an illegal function call or reference to a nonexistent built-in
  variable should cause a command to fail.  OFF by default.
```

### SET GET-PUT-REMOTE

```
Syntax: SET GET-PUT-REMOTE { AUTO, FTP, KERMIT}
  Tells Kermit whether GET, PUT, and REMOTE commands should be directed
  at a Kermit server or an FTP server.  The default is AUTO, meaning that
  if you have only one active connection, the appropriate action is taken
  when you give a GET, PUT, or REMOTE command.  SET GET-PUT-REMOTE FTP forces
  Kermit to treat GET, PUT, and REMOTE as FTP client commands; setting this
  to KERMIT forces these commands to be treated as Kermit client commands.
  NOTE: PUT includes SEND, MPUT, MSEND, and all other similar commands.
  Also see HELP REMOTE, HELP SET LOCUS, HELP FTP.
```

### SET HANDSHAKE

```
Syntax: SET HANDSHAKE { NONE, XON, LF, BELL, ESC, CODE number }
  Character to use for half duplex line turnaround handshake during file
  transfer.  C-Kermit waits for this character from the other computer
  before sending its next packet.  Default is NONE; you can give one of the
  other names like BELL or ESC, or use SET HANDSHAKE CODE to specify the
  numeric code value of the handshake character.  Type SET HANDSH ? for a
  complete list of possibilities.
```

### SET HINTS

```
Not available - "help set hints"
```

### SET HOST

```
SET HOST [ switches ] hostname-or-address [ service ] [ protocol-switch ]
  Establishes a connection to the specified network host on the currently
  selected network type.  For TCP/IP connections, the default service is
  TELNET; specify a different TCP port number or service name to choose a
  different service.
 
  An IPv6 address containing colons (such as ::1) must be enclosed in
  brackets if followed by a colon-separated port, e.g. "[::1]:23".
  A port given as a separate space-delimited argument does not require
  brackets, e.g. "::1 23" or "[::1] 23".
 
  Which IP address family actually gets used for a hostname that has
  both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses is controlled by SET TCP ADDRESS-FAMILY. For
  SET HOST * (listen for an incoming connection), the same setting
  controls which family (or families) are listened on.
 
  A link-local address (fe80::/10) requires a zone identifying its
  interface, specified as a %interface or %index suffix, e.g.
  "[fe80::1%eth0]:23". Connecting to a link-local address without a zone
  fails.
 
  For KVM/Linux VSOCK connections (SET NETWORK TYPE VSOCK, or
  SET HOST /NETWORK-TYPE:VSOCK), the host argument is "CID:PORT", e.g.
  "1:9600".  There is no name resolution, so the CID and port are always
  given directly.  The CID may also be one of the symbolic names ANY,
  HYPERVISOR, LOCAL, or HOST in place of a number.  CID 1 (LOCAL) is the
  VSOCK loopback address, analogous to IPv4's 127.0.0.1.  SSL/TLS and
  Telnet negotiation are never used over a VSOCK connection.
 
  SET HOST * (or SET HOST /SERVER) listens for an incoming VSOCK
  connection.  An optional ":PORT" selects the port to listen on,
  e.g. "SET HOST *:9600"; the default is port 1649.
 
  The first set of switches can be:
 
 /NETWORK-TYPE:name
   Makes the connection on the given type of network.  Equivalent to SET
   NETWORK TYPE name prior to SET HOST, except that the selected network
   type is used only for this connection.  Type "set host /net:?" to see
   a list.  /NETWORK-TYPE:COMMAND means to make the connection through the
   given system command, such as "rlogin" or "cu".
 
 /CONNECT
   Enter CONNECT (terminal) mode automatically if the connection is successful.
 
 /SERVER
   Enter server mode automatically if the connection is successful.
 
 /USERID:[<name>]
   This switch is equivalent to SET LOGIN USERID <name> or SET TELNET
   ENVIRONMENT USER <name>.  If a string is given, it sent to host during
   Telnet negotiations; if this switch is given but the string is omitted,
   no user ID is sent to the host.  If this switch is not given, your
   current USERID value, \v(userid), is sent.  When a userid is sent to the
   host it is a request to login as the specified user.
 
 /PASSWORD:[<string>]
   This switch is equivalent to SET LOGIN PASSWORD.  If a string is given,
   it is treated as the password to be used (if required) by any Telnet
   Authentication protocol (Kerberos Ticket retrieval, Secure Remote
   Password, or X.509 certificate private key decryption.)  If no password
   switch is specified a prompt is issued to request the password if one
   is required for the negotiated authentication method.
 
The protocol-switches can be:
 
 /NO-TELNET-INIT
   Do not send initial Telnet negotiations even if this is a Telnet port.
 
 /RAW-SOCKET
   This is a connection to a raw TCP socket.
 
 /RLOGIN
   Use Rlogin protocol even if this is not an Rlogin port.
 
 /TELNET
   Send initial Telnet negotiations even if this is not a Telnet port.
 
 /SSL
   Perform SSL negotiations.
 
 /SSL-TELNET
   Perform SSL negotiations and if successful start Telnet negotiations.
 
 /TLS
   Perform TLS negotiations.
 
 /TLS-TELNET
   Perform TLS negotiations and if successful start Telnet negotiations.
 
Examples:
  SET HOST kermit.columbia.edu
  SET HOST /CONNECT kermit.columbia.edu
  SET HOST * 1649
  SET HOST /SERVER * 1649
  SET HOST 128.59.39.2
  SET HOST madlab.sprl.umich.edu 3000
  SET HOST xyzcorp.com 2000 /RAW-SOCKET
  SET HOST 127.0.0.1:12345
  SET HOST 127.0.0.1 12345      (same function as the prior line)
  SET HOST [::1]:12345
  SET HOST [::1] 12345          (same function as the prior line)
  SET HOST /CONNECT /COMMAND rlogin xyzcorp.com
 
The TELNET command is equivalent to SET NETWORK TYPE TCP/IP,
SET HOST name [ port ] /TELNET, IF SUCCESS CONNECT
 
The SSH command is equivalent to SET HOST /PTY /CONNECT ssh -e none hostname
 
Also see SET NETWORK, SSH, TELNET, SET TELNET.

### SET INPUT

Synonyms: I, IN

```
Syntax: SET INPUT parameter value
 
SET INPUT AUTODOWNLOAD { ON, OFF }
  Controls whether autodownloads are allowed during INPUT command execution.
 
SET INPUT BUFFER-LENGTH number-of-bytes
  Removes the old INPUT buffer and creates a new one with the given length.
 
SET INPUT CANCELLATION { ON, OFF }
  Whether an INPUT in progress can be can interrupted from the keyboard.
 
SET INPUT CASE { IGNORE, OBSERVE }
  Tells whether alphabetic case is to be significant in string comparisons.
  This setting is local to the current macro or command file, and is
  inherited by subordinate macros and take files.
 
SET INPUT ECHO { ON, OFF }
  Tells whether to display arriving characters read by INPUT on the screen.
 
SET INPUT SCALE-FACTOR <number>
  A number to multiply all INPUT timeouts by, which may include a fractional
  part, e.g. 2.5.  All INPUT commands that specify a timeout in seconds
  (as opposed to a specific time of day) have their time limit adjusted
  automatically by this factor, which is also available in the built-in
  read-only variable \v(inscale).  The default value is 1.0.
 
SET INPUT SILENCE <number>
  The maximum number to seconds of silence (no input at all) before the
  INPUT command times out, 0 for no maximum.
 
SET INPUT TIMEOUT-ACTION { PROCEED, QUIT }
  Tells whether to proceed or quit from a script program if an INPUT command
  fails.  PROCEED (default) allows use of IF SUCCESS / IF FAILURE commands.
  This setting is local to the current macro or command file, and is
  inherited by subordinate macros and take files.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW INPUT`:

```
 Input autodownload:     off
 Input cancellation:     on
 Input case:             ignore
 Input buffer-length:    4096
 Input echo:             on

```

### SET I

Synonym for [SET INPUT](#set-input).

### SET IN

Synonym for [SET INPUT](#set-input).

### SET IKS

```
SET IKS ANONYMOUS INITFILE filename
  The initialization file to be executed for anonymous logins.  By default
  it is .kermrc in the anonymous root directory.  This option is independent
  of the SET IKS INITFILE command which applies only to real users.
 
SET IKS ANONYMOUS LOGIN { ON, OFF }
  Whether anonymous logins are allowed. By default they are allowed, so this
  option need be included only to disallow them (or for clarity, to emphasize
  they are allowed). Anonymous login occurs when the username "anonymous"
  or "ftp" is given, with any password (as with ftpd).
 
SET IKS ANONYMOUS ROOT <directory>
  Specifies a directory tree to which anonymous users are restricted after
  login.
 
SET IKS BANNERFILE <filename>
  The name of a file containing a message to be printed after the user logs
  in, in place of the normal message (copyright notice, "Type HELP or ? for
  help", etc).
 
SET IKS CDFILE <filelist>
  When cdmessage is on, this is the name of the "read me" file to be shown.
  Normally you would specify a relative (not absolute) name, since the file
  is opened using the literal name you specified, after changing to the new
  directory.  Example:
 
    SET IKS CDFILE READ.ME
 
  You can also give a list of up to 8 filenames by (a) enclosing each
  filename in braces, and (b) enclosing the entire list in braces.  Example:
 
    SET IKS CDFILE {{READ.ME}{aareadme.txt}{README}{read-this-first}}
 
  When a list is given, it is searched from left to right and the first
  file found is displayed.
 
SET IKS CDMESSAGE {ON, OFF, 0, 1, 2}
  For use in the Server-Side Server configuration; whenever the client
  tells the server to change directory, the server sends the contents of a
  "read me" file to the client's screen.  This feature is ON by default,
  and operates in client/server mode only when ON or 1.  If set to 2 or
  higher, it also operates when the CD command is given at the IKSD> prompt.
  Synonym: SET IKS CDMSG.
 
SET IKS DATABASE { ON, OFF }
  This command determines whether entries are inserted into the SET IKS
  DBFILE (IKSD active sessions database).
 
SET IKS DBFILE <filename>
  Specifies the file which should be used for storing runtime status
  information about active connections.  The default is a file called
  "iksd.db" in the /var/log directory.
 
 
SET IKS HELPFILE <filename>
  Specifies the name of a file to be displayed if the user types HELP
  (not followed by a specific command or topic), in place of the built-in
  top-level help text.  The file need not fit on one screen; more-prompting
  is used if the file is more than one screen long if COMMAND MORE-PROMPTING
  is ON, as it is by default.
 
SET IKS INITFILE <filename>
  Execute <filename> rather than the normal initialization file for real
  users; this option does not apply to anonymous users.
 
SET IKS NO-INITFILE { ON, OFF }
  Do not execute an initialization file, even if a real user is logging in.
 
SET IKS SERVER-ONLY { ON, OFF }
  If this option is included on the IKSD command line, the Client Side Server
  configuration is disabled, and the user will not get a Username: or
  Password: prompt, and will not be able to access the IKSD command prompt.
  A FINISH command sent to the IKSD will log it out and close the
  connection, rather than returning it to its prompt.
 
SET IKS TIMEOUT <number>
  This sets a limit (in seconds) on the amount of time the client has to log
  in once the connection is made.  If successful login does not occur within
  the given number of seconds, the connection is closed.  The default timeout
  is 300 seconds (5 minutes).  A value of 0 or less indicates there is to be
  no limit.
 
SET IKS USERFILE <filename>
  This file contains a list of local usernames that are to be denied access
  to Internet Kermit Service.  The default is /etc/ftpusers.  This can be the
  same file that is used by wuftpd, and the syntax is the same: one username
  per line; lines starting with "#" are ignored.  Use this option to
  specify the name of a different forbidden-user file, or use
  "set iks userfile /dev/null" to disable this feature in case there is a
   /etc/ftpusers file but you don't want to use it.
 
SET IKS XFERLOG { ON, OFF }
  Whether a file-transfer log should be kept.  Off by default.  If "on",
  but no SET IKSD XFERFILE command is given, /var/log/iksd.log is used.
 
SET IKS XFERFILE <filename>
  Use this option to specify an iksd log file name.  If you include this
  option, it implies SET IKS XFERFILE ON.
```

### SET INCOMPLETE

```
Syntax: SET INCOMPLETE { DISCARD, KEEP }
  Whether to discard or keep incompletely received files, default is KEEP.
```

### SET KEY

```
Syntax: SET KEY k text
Or:     SET KEY CLEAR
  Configure the key whose "scan code" is k to send the given text when
  pressed during CONNECT mode.  SET KEY CLEAR restores all the default
  key mappings.  If there is no text, the default key binding is restored
  for the key k.  SET KEY mappings take place before terminal character-set
  translation.
 
  To find out the scan code and mapping for a particular key, use the
  SHOW KEY command.
```

### SET LINE

Synonyms: L, PORT

```
Syntax: SET LINE (or SET PORT) [ switches ] [ devicename ]
  Selects a serial-port device to use for making connections.
  Typical device name for this platform: /dev/ttyS0.
  The default device name is /dev/tty (i.e. none).
  If you do not give a SET LINE command or if you give a SET LINE command
  with no device name, or if you specify /dev/tty as the device name,
  Kermit will be in "remote mode", suitable for use on the far end of a
  connection, e.g. as the file-transfer partner of your desktop communication
  software.  If you SET LINE to a specific device other than /dev/tty,
  Kermit is in "local mode", suitable for making a connection to another
  computer.  SET LINE alone resets Kermit to remote mode.
  To use a modem to dial out, first SET MODEM TYPE (e.g., to USR), then
  SET LINE xxx, then SET SPEED, then give a DIAL command.
  For direct null-modem connections, use SET MODEM TYPE NONE, SET LINE xxx,
  then SET FLOW, SET SPEED, and CONNECT.

Optional switches:
  /CONNECT - Enter CONNECT mode automatically if SET LINE succeeds.
  /SERVER  - Enter server mode automatically if SET LINE succeeds.

Also see HELP SET MODEM, HELP SET DIAL, HELP SET SPEED, HELP SET FLOW.
```

### SET L

Synonym for [SET LINE](#set-line).

### SET PORT

Synonym for [SET LINE](#set-line).

### SET LANGUAGE

```
Syntax: SET LANGUAGE name
  Selects language-specific translation rules for text-mode file transfers.
  Used with SET FILE CHARACTER-SET and SET TRANSFER CHARACTER-SET when one
  of these is ASCII.
```

### SET LOCAL-ECHO

```
Syntax: SET LOCAL-ECHO { OFF, ON }
  During CONNECT: OFF means remote host echoes, ON means Kermit
  does its own echoing.  Synonym for SET DUPLEX { FULL, HALF }.
```

### SET LOCALE

```
Syntax: SET LOCALE [ locale-string ]
  Changes the locale for language and character-set to the one given.  The
  local-string is in the format required by your computer, such as
  en_US.US-ASCII or es_VE.ISO8859-1.  C-Kermit's SET LOCALE command affects
  C-Kermit itself and any subprocesses, but does not affect the environment
  from which C-Kermit was invoked.
```

### SET LOCUS

```
Syntax: SET LOCUS { AUTO, LOCAL, REMOTE }
  Specifies whether unprefixed file management commands should operate
  locally or (when there is a connection to a remote FTP or Kermit
  server) sent to the server.  The affected commands are: CD (CWD), PWD,
  CDUP, DIRECTORY, DELETE, RENAME, MKDIR, and RMDIR.  To force any of
  these commands to be executed locally, give it an L-prefix: LCD, LDIR,
  etc.  To force remote execution, use the R-prefix: RCD, RDIR, and so
  on.  SHOW COMMAND shows the current Locus.
 
  By default, the Locus for file management commands is switched
  automatically whenever you make or close a connection: if you make an
  FTP connection, the Locus becomes REMOTE; if you close an FTP connection
  or make any other kind of connection, the Locus becomes LOCAL.
 
  If you give a SET LOCUS LOCAL or SET LOCUS REMOTE command, this sets
  the locus as indicated and disables automatic switching.
  SET LOCUS AUTO restores automatic switching.
```

### SET LOGIN

```
Not available - "help set login"
```

### SET MACRO

```
Syntax: SET MACRO parameter value
  Controls the behavior of macros.
 
SET MACRO ECHO { ON, OFF }
  Tells whether commands executed from a macro definition should be
  displayed on the screen.  OFF by default; use ON for debugging.
 
SET MACRO ERROR { ON, OFF }
  Tells whether a macro should be automatically terminated upon a command
  error.  This setting is local to the current macro, and inherited by
  subordinate macros.
```

### SET MATCH

```
SET MATCH { DOTFILE, FIFO } { ON, OFF }
  Tells whether wildcards should match dotfiles (files whose names begin
  with period) or UNIX FIFO special files.  MATCH FIFO default is OFF.
  MATCH DOTFILE default is OFF in UNIX, ON elsewhere.
```

### SET MODEM

```
Syntax: SET MODEM <parameter> <value> ...
 
Note: Many of the SET MODEM parameters are configured automatically when
you SET MODEM TYPE, according to the modem's capabilities.  SHOW MODEM to
see them.  Also see HELP DIAL and HELP SET DIAL.
 
SET MODEM TYPE <name>
 Tells Kermit which kind of modem you have, so it can issue the
 appropriate modem-specific commands for configuration, dialing, and
 hanging up.  For a list of the modem types known to Kermit, type "set
 modem type ?".  The default modem type is GENERIC, which should work
 with any AT command-set modem that is configured for error correction,
 data compression, and hardware flow control.  Use SET MODEM TYPE NONE
 for direct serial, connections.  Use SET MODEM TYPE USER-DEFINED to use
 a type of modem that is not built in to Kermit, and then use SET MODEM
 CAPABILITIES, SET MODEM, DIAL-COMMAND, and SET MODEM COMMAND to tell
 Kermit how to configure and control it.
 
SET MODEM CAPABILITIES <list>
  Use this command for changing Kermit's idea of your modem's capabilities,
  for example, if your modem is supposed to have built-in error correction
  but in fact does not.  Also use this command to define the capabilities
  of a USER-DEFINED modem.  Capabilities are:
 
    AT      AT-commands
    DC      data-compression
    EC      error-correction
    HWFC    hardware-flow
    ITU     v25bis-commands
    SWFC    software-flow
    KS      kermit-spoof
    SB      speed-buffering
    TB      Telebit
 
SET MODEM CARRIER-WATCH { AUTO, ON, OFF }
  Synonym for SET CARRIER-WATCH (q.v.)
 
SET MODEM COMPRESSION { ON, OFF }
  Enables/disables the modem's data compression feature, if any.
 
SET MODEM DIAL-COMMAND <text>
  The text replaces Kermit's built-in modem dialing command.  It must
  include '%s' (percent s) as a place-holder for the telephone numbers
  given in your DIAL commands.
 
SET MODEM ERROR-CORRECTION { ON, OFF }
  Enables/disables the modem's error-correction feature, if any.
 
SET MODEM ESCAPE-CHARACTER number
  Numeric ASCII value of modem's escape character, e.g. 43 for '+'.
  For Hayes-compatible modems, Kermit uses three copies, e.g. "+++".
 
SET MODEM FLOW-CONTROL {AUTO, NONE, RTS/CTS, XON/XOFF}
  Selects the type of local flow control to be used by the modem.
 
SET MODEM HANGUP-METHOD { MODEM-COMMAND, RS232-SIGNAL, DTR }
  How hangup operations should be done.  MODEM-COMMAND means try to
  escape back to the modem's command processor and give a modem-specific
  hangup command.  RS232-SIGNAL means turn off the DTR signal.  DTR is a
  synonym for RS232-SIGNAL.
 
SET MODEM KERMIT-SPOOF {ON, OFF}
  If the selected modem type supports the Kermit protocol directly,
  use this command to turn its Kermit protocol function on or off.
 
SET MODEM MAXIMUM-SPEED <number>
  Specify the maximum interface speed for the modem.
 
SET MODEM NAME <text>
  Descriptive name for a USER-DEFINED modem.
 
SET MODEM SPEAKER {ON, OFF}
  Turns the modem's speaker on or off during dialing.
 
SET MODEM SPEED-MATCHING {ON, OFF}
  ON means that C-Kermit changes its serial interface speed to agree with
  the speed reported by the modem's CONNECT message, if any.  OFF means
  Kermit should not change its interface speed.
 
SET MODEM VOLUME {LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH}
  Selects the desired modem speaker volume for when the speaker is ON.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND commands are used to override built-in modem commands for
each modem type, or to fill in commands for the USER-DEFINED modem type.
Omitting the optional [ text ] restores the built-in modem-specific command,
if any:
 
SET MODEM COMMAND AUTOANSWER {ON, OFF} [ text ]
  Modem commands to turn autoanswer on and off.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND COMPRESSION {ON, OFF} [ text ]
  Modem commands to turn data compression on and off.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND ERROR-CORRECTION {ON, OFF} [ text ]
  Modem commands to turn error correction on and off.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND HANGUP [ text ]
  Command that tells the modem to hang up the connection.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND IGNORE-DIALTONE [ text ]
  Command that tells the modem not to wait for dialtone before dialing.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND INIT-STRING [ text ]
  The 'text' is a replacement for C-Kermit's built-in initialization command
  for the modem.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND PREDIAL-INIT [ text ]
  A second INIT-STRING that is to be sent to the modem just prior to dialing.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND HARDWARE-FLOW [ text ]
  Modem command to enable hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) in the modem.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND SOFTWARE-FLOW [ text ]
  Modem command to enable local software flow control (Xon/Xoff) in modem.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND SPEAKER { ON, OFF } [ text ]
  Modem command to turn the modem's speaker on or off.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND NO-FLOW-CONTROL [ text ]
  Modem command to disable local flow control in the modem.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND PULSE [ text ]
  Modem command to select pulse dialing.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND TONE [ text ]
  Modem command to select tone dialing.
 
SET MODEM COMMAND VOLUME { LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH } [ text ]
  Modem command to set the modem's speaker volume.

### SET PROTOCOL

```
Syntax: SET PROTOCOL { KERMIT, XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM } [ s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 ]
  Selects protocol to use for transferring files.  s1 and s2 are commands to
  output prior to SENDing with this protocol, to automatically start the
  RECEIVE process on the other end in binary or text mode, respectively.
  If the protocol is KERMIT, s3 is the command to start a Kermit server on
  the remote computer, and there are no s4-s6 commands.  Otherwise, s3 and
  s4 are commands used on this computer for sending files with this protocol
  in binary or text mode, respectively; s5 and s6 are the commands for
  receiving files with this protocol.  Use "%s" in any of these strings
  to represent the filename(s).  Use { braces } if any command contains
  spaces.  Examples:
 
    set proto kermit {kermit -YQir} {kermit -YQTr} {kermit -YQx}
    set proto ymodem rb {rb -a} {sb %s} {sb -a %s} rb rb
 
External protocols require REDIRECT and external file transfer programs that
use redirectable standard input/output.
 
SET PROTOCOL STARTUP-STRING { ON, OFF }
  Whether to send s1/s2/s3 (or the current protocol's, if already set)
  to the far end to launch a protocol program as appropriate.  ON
  (the default) assumes the far end is a shell that the string needs
  to be typed at, which is normally the case.  Most external protocols
  ignore the extra string if it is unnecessary.  Turn this OFF if the
  startup string would cause undesirable behavior on the remote.
 
  SHOW PROTOCOL displays the current settings.
```

### SET QUIET

Synonym: Q

```
Syntax: SET QUIET {ON, OFF}
  Normally OFF.  ON disables most information messages during interactive
  operation.
```

### SET Q

Synonym for [SET QUIET](#set-quiet).

### SET Q8FLAG

```
Not available - "help set q8flag"
```

### SET QNX-PORT-LOCK

```
Not available - "help set qnx-port-lock"
```

### SET RECEIVE

Synonyms: REC, RECV

```
Syntax: SET RECEIVE parameter value
  Specifies parameters for inbound packets:
 
SET RECEIVE CHARACTER-SET { AUTOMATIC, MANUAL }
  Whether to automatically switch to an appropriate file-character set based
  on the transfer character-set announcer, if any, of an incoming text file.
  AUTOMATIC by default.  Also see HELP ASSOCIATE.
 
SET RECEIVE CONFIRM { OFF, ON, ALL } [ LOCAL, REMOTE, BOTH ]
  Controls whether Kermit prompts for confirmation before writing an
  incoming file, guarding against unexpected filenames from a remote host.
  ON (the default) prompts, except when the incoming name is a precise
  (non-wildcard) match for a name given to GET or MGET, or, for a
  recursive GET, when the file arrives under the directory named for the
  transfer. A RECEIVE, or a transfer accepted because the remote host
  issued SEND, always prompts, since no local filename specification
  exists for comparison.
 
  ALL applies the same matching rules as ON, but also prompts for each
  individual file inside a recursive transfer. Use ALL, not ON, if you
  want every file in a recursive transfer confirmed by name before it
  can collide with anything already on disk; ON alone does not fully
  substitute for SET FILE COLLISION REJECT there.
 
  OFF never prompts.
 
  The optional LOCAL/REMOTE/BOTH scope (LOCAL by default) controls whether
  this setting applies when this Kermit is the local or remote end of the
  connection. A Kermit acting as an unattended server (SERVER command or
  IKSD) never prompts, regardless of this setting.
 
  GET, MGET, and RECEIVE also accept a /CONFIRM:{OFF,ON,ALL} switch to
  override this setting for one command.
 
SET RECEIVE CONTROL-PREFIX number
  ASCII value of prefix character used for quoting control characters in
  packets that Kermit receives, normally 35 (number sign).  Don't change
  this unless something is wrong with the other Kermit program.
 
SET RECEIVE END-OF-PACKET number
  ASCII value of control character that terminates incoming packets,
  normally 13 (carriage return).
 
SET RECEIVE IGNORE-CHARACTER number
  ASCII value of character to be discarded when receiving packets, such as
  line folding characters.
 
SET RECEIVE MOVE-TO [ directory ]
  If a directory name is specified, then every file that is received
  successfully is moved to the given directory immediately after reception
  is complete.  Omit the directory name to remove any previously set move-to
  directory.
 
SET RECEIVE PACKET-LENGTH number
  Maximum length packet the other Kermit should send.
 
SET RECEIVE PADDING number
  Number of prepacket padding characters to ask for (normally 0).
 
SET RECEIVE PAD-CHARACTER number
  ASCII value of control character to use for padding (normally 0).
 
SET RECEIVE PATHNAMES {OFF, ABSOLUTE, RELATIVE, AUTO}
  If a recognizable path (directory, device) specification appears in an
  incoming filename, strip it OFF before trying to create the output file.
  Otherwise, then if any of the directories in the path don't exist, Kermit
  tries to create them, relative to your current or download directory, or
  absolutely, as specified.  RELATIVE means require all incoming names to be
  relative to your current or download directory, and also confined to be
  a descendant of it.
 
  AUTO, which is the default, means RELATIVE if the file sender indicates in
  advance that this is a recursive transfer, otherwise OFF.
 
  ABSOLUTE honors all incoming pathnames exactly as given.
 
  RECEIVE PATHNAMES governs how an accepted pathname is placed, and
  applies equally to files arriving from a GET /RECURSIVE or from
  someone else's SEND /RECURSIVE; see HELP GET and HELP SEND.
 
  This is separate from ENABLE/DISABLE CD (HELP ENABLE), but this also
  interact when running as a SERVER.  See doc/permissions.md for an
  extensive discussion of this topic.
 
SET RECEIVE PAUSE number
  Milliseconds to pause between packets, normally 0.
 
SET RECEIVE PERMISSIONS { ON, OFF }
  Whether to copy file permissions from inbound Attribute packets.
 
SET RECEIVE RENAME-TO [ template ]
  If a template is specified, then every file that is received successfully
  is renamed according to the given template immediately after it is received.
  The template should include variables like \v(filename) or \v(filenumber).
  Omit the template to remove any template previously set.
 
SET RECEIVE START-OF-PACKET number
  ASCII value of character that marks start of inbound packet.
 
SET RECEIVE TIMEOUT number
  Number of seconds the other Kermit should wait for a packet before sending
  a NAK or retransmitting.
```

### SET REC

Synonym for [SET RECEIVE](#set-receive).

### SET RECV

Synonym for [SET RECEIVE](#set-receive).

### SET RELIABLE

```
Syntax: SET RELIABLE { ON, OFF, AUTO }
  Tells Kermit whether its connection is reliable.  Default is AUTO,
  meaning Kermit should figure it out for itself.
```

### SET RENAME

```
SET RENAME LIST { ON, OFF }
  Tells whether the RENAME command should list its results by default.

SET RENAME COLLISION { FAIL, PROCEED, OVERWRITE }
  Establishes the default action when renaming a file would destroy an
  existing file.  See HELP RENAME.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW RENAME`:

```
 rename collision: overwrite
 rename list:      off
```

### SET REPEAT

```
Syntax: SET REPEAT { COUNTS { ON, OFF }, PREFIX <code> }
  SET REPEAT COUNTS turns the repeat-count compression mechanism ON and OFF.
  The default is ON.  SET REPEAT PREFIX <code> sets the repeat-count prefix
  character to the given code.  The default is 126 (tilde).
```

### SET RETRY-LIMIT

```
Syntax: SET RETRY number
  In Kermit protocol file transfers: How many times to retransmit a
  particular packet before giving up; 0 = no limit.
```

### SET ROOT

```
Syntax: SET ROOT directoryname
  Sets the root for file access to the given directory and disables access
  to system and shell commands and external programs.  Once this command
  is given, no files or directories outside the tree rooted by the given
  directory can be opened, read, listed, deleted, renamed, or accessed in
  any other way.  This command can not be undone by a subsequent SET ROOT
  command.  Primarily for use with server mode, to restrict access of
  clients to a particular directory tree.  Synonym: CHROOT.
```

### SET SCRIPT

```
Syntax: SET SCRIPT ECHO { OFF, ON }
  Disables/Enables echoing of SCRIPT command operation.
```

### SET SEND

```
Syntax: SET SEND parameter value
  Specifies parameters for outbound files or packets.
 
SET SEND BACKUP { ON, OFF }
  Tells whether to include backup files when sending file groups.  Backup
  files are those created by Kermit, EMACS, etc, when creating a new file
  that has the same name as an existing file.  A backup file has a version
  appended to its name, e.g. oofa.txt.~23~.  ON is the default, meaning
  don't exclude backup files.  Use OFF to exclude backup files from group
  transfers.
 
SET SEND CHARACTER-SET { AUTOMATIC, MANUAL }
  Whether to automatically switch to an appropriate file-character when a
  SET TRANSFER CHARACTER-SET command is given, or vice versa.  AUTOMATIC by
  default.  Also see HELP ASSOCIATE.
 
SET SEND CONTROL-PREFIX number
  ASCII value of prefix character used for quoting control characters in
  packets that Kermit sends, normally 35 (number sign).
 
SET SEND DOUBLE-CHARACTER number
  ASCII value of character to be doubled when sending packets, such as an
  X.25 PAD escape character.
 
SET SEND END-OF-PACKET number
  ASCII value of control character to terminate an outbound packet,
  normally 13 (carriage return).
 
SET SEND MOVE-TO [ directory ]
  If a directory name is specified, then every file that is sent successfully
  is moved to the given directory immediately after it is sent.
  Omit the directory name to remove any previously set move-to directory.
 
SET SEND PACKET-LENGTH number
  Maximum length packet to send, even if other Kermit asks for longer ones.
  This command can not be used to force packets to be sent that are longer
  than the length requested by the receiver.  Use this command only to
  force shorter ones.
 
SET SEND PADDING number
  Number of prepacket padding characters to send.
 
SET SEND PAD-CHARACTER number
  ASCII value of control character to use for padding.
 
SET SEND PATHNAMES {OFF, ABSOLUTE, RELATIVE}
  Include the path (device, directory) portion with the file name when
  sending it as specified; ABSOLUTE means to send the whole pathname,
  RELATIVE means to include the pathname relative to the current directory.
  Applies to the actual filename, not to the "as-name".  The default is
  OFF.
 
SET SEND PAUSE number
  Milliseconds to pause between packets, normally 0.
 
SET SEND PERMISSIONS { ON, OFF }
  Whether to include file permissions in outbound Attribute packets.
 
SET SEND RENAME-TO [ template ]
  If a template is specified, then every file that is sent successfully
  is renamed according to the given template immediately after it is sent.
  The template should include variables like \v(filename) or \v(filenumber).
  Omit the template to remove any template previously set.
 
SET SEND START-OF-PACKET number
  ASCII value of character to mark start of outbound packet.
 
SET SEND TIMEOUT number [ { DYNAMIC [ min max ] ], FIXED } ]
  Number of seconds to wait for a packet before sending NAK or
  retransmitting.  Include the word DYNAMIC after the number in the
  SET SEND TIMEOUT command to have Kermit compute the timeouts dynamically
  throughout the transfer based on the packet rate.  Include the word FIXED
  to use the "number" given throughout the transfer.  DYNAMIC is the
  default.  After DYNAMIC you may include minimum and maximum values.
  SET SEND TIMEOUT -1 FIXED means no timeouts.
```

### SET SERVER

Synonym: SER

```
SET SERVER CD-MESSAGE {ON,OFF}
  Tells whether the server, after successfully executing a REMOTE CD
  command, should send the contents of the new directory's READ.ME
  (or similar) file to your screen.
 
SET SERVER CD-MESSAGE FILE name
  Tells the name of the file to be displayed as a CD-MESSAGE, such as
  READ.ME (SHOW SERVER tells the current CD-MESSAGE FILE name).
  To specify more than one filename to look for, use {{name1}{name2}..}.
  Synonym: SET CD MESSAGE FILE <list>.
 
SET SERVER DISPLAY {ON,OFF}
  Tells whether local-mode C-Kermit during server operation should put a
  file transfer display on the screen.  Default is OFF.
 
SET SERVER GET-PATH [ directory [ directory [ ... ] ] ]
  Tells the C-Kermit server where to look for files whose names it receives
  from client GET commands when the names are not fully specified pathnames.
  Default is no GET-PATH, so C-Kermit looks only in its current directory.
 
SET SERVER IDLE-TIMEOUT seconds
  Idle time limit while in server mode, 0 for no limit.
  NOTE: SERVER IDLE-TIMEOUT and SERVER TIMEOUT are mutually exclusive.
 
SET SERVER KEEPALIVE {ON,OFF}
  Tells whether C-Kermit should send "keepalive" packets while executing
  REMOTE HOST commands, which is useful in case the command takes a long
  time to produce any output and therefore might cause the operation to time
  out.  ON by default; turn it OFF if it causes trouble with the client or
  slows down the server too much.
 
SET SERVER LOGIN [ username [ password [ account ] ] ]
  Sets up a username and optional password which must be supplied before
  the server will respond to any commands other than REMOTE LOGIN.  The
  account is ignored.  If you enter SET SERVER LOGIN by itself, then login
  is no longer required.  Only one SET SERVER LOGIN command can be in effect
  at a time; C-Kermit does not support multiple user/password pairs.
 
SET SERVER TIMEOUT n
  Server command wait timeout interval, how often the C-Kermit server issues
  a NAK while waiting for a command packet.  Specify 0 for no NAKs at all.
  Default is 0.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW SERVER`:

```

### SET SER

Synonym for [SET SERVER](#set-server).

### SET SERIAL

```
Syntax: SET SERIAL dps
  d is data length in bits, 7 or 8; p is first letter of parity; s is stop
  bits, 1 or 2.  Examples: "set serial 7e1", "set serial 8n1".
```

### SET SESSION-LOG

Synonym: SESSION-L

```
Syntax:
 SET SESSION-LOG { BINARY, DEBUG, NULL-PADDED, TEXT, TIMESTAMPED-TEXT }
  If BINARY, record all CONNECT characters in session log.  If TEXT, strip
  out CR, NUL, and XON/XOFF characters.  DEBUG is the same as BINARY but
  also includes Telnet negotiations on TCP/IP connections.
```

### SET SESSION-L

Synonym for [SET SESSION-LOG](#set-session-log).

### SET SEXPRESSION

```
SET SEXPRESSION { DEPTH-LIMIT, ECHO-RESULT, TRUNCATE-ALL-RESULTS }
  DEPTH-LIMIT sets a limit on the depth of nesting or recursion in
  S-Expressions to prevent the program from crashing from memory exhaustion.
  ECHO-RESULT tells whether S-Expression results should be displayed as
  a result of evaluating an expression; the default is to display only at
  top (interactive) level; OFF means never display; ON means always display.
  TRUNCATE-ALL-RESULTS ON means the results of all arithmetic operations
  should be forced to integers (whole numbers) by discarding any fractional
  part.  The default is OFF.  SHOW SEXPRESSION displays the current settings.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW SEXPRESSION`:

```
 sexpression echo-result: automatic
 sexpression depth-limit: 1000

 maximum depth reached:   0
 longest result returned: 0

 truncate all results:    off

 last sexpression:        (none)
 last value:              (none)
```

### SET SSH

```
Syntax: SET SSH COMMAND command
  Specifies the external command to be used to make an SSH connection.
  By default it is "ssh -e none" (ssh with no escape character).
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW SSH`:

```
 SSH is external.

 ssh command: ssh -e none
```

### SET STARTUP-FILE

```
Not available - "help set startup-file"
```

### SET STOP-BITS

```
Syntax: SET STOP-BITS { 1, 2 }
  Number of stop bits to use on SET LINE connections, normally 1.
```

### SET STREAMING

```
Syntax: SET STREAMING { ON, OFF, AUTO }
  Tells Kermit whether streaming protocol can be used during Kermit file
  transfers.  Default is AUTO, meaning use it if connection is reliable.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW STREAMING`:

```
 Reliable:     automatic
 Clearchannel: automatic
 Streaming:    automatic

 Streaming will be done if requested.
 Last transfer: no streaming, 0 cps.
```

### SET SUSPEND

```
Syntax: SET SUSPEND { OFF, ON }
  Disables SUSPEND command, suspend signals, and <esc-char>Z during CONNECT.
```

### SET TAKE

```
Syntax: SET TAKE parameter value
 
  Controls behavior of TAKE command:
 
SET TAKE ECHO { ON, OFF }
  Tells whether commands read from a TAKE file should be displayed on the
  screen (if so, each command is shown at the time it is read, and labeled
  with a line number).
 
SET TAKE ERROR { ON, OFF }
  Tells whether a TAKE command file should be automatically terminated when
  a command fails.  This setting is local to the current command file, and
  inherited by subordinate command files.
```

### SET TCP

```
SET TCP ADDRESS <ip-address>
  This allows a specific local IPv4 address on a multihomed host to be used
  instead of allowing the TCP/IP stack to choose.  This may be necessary
  when using authentication or listening for an incoming connection.
  Specify no <ip-address> to remove the preference.  <ip-address> must
  be an IPv4 literal.
 
  This setting only affects IPv4 connections and listeners.  It is
  applied to an IPv4 candidate when SET TCP ADDRESS-FAMILY is AUTO or
  IPV4, and has no effect on IPv6 candidates.  See SET TCP ADDRESS6 for
  the IPv6 equivalent.  The two are independent.
 
SET TCP ADDRESS6 <ipv6-address>
  Like SET TCP ADDRESS, but for IPv6.  It gives a specific IPv6 address
  on a multihomed host to use as the local address for outgoing IPv6
  connections and the IPv6 listening socket, instead of letting the
  TCP/IP stack choose.  <ipv6-address> must be an IPv6 literal.  Specify
  no <ipv6-address> to remove the preference.  Only affects IPv6
  connections and listeners.
 
  A link-local address (fe80::/10) requires a zone identifying its
  interface. Specify <ipv6-address> with a %interface (e.g. fe80::1%eth0)
  or %index (e.g. fe80::1%2) suffix.
 
SET TCP CONNECT-TIMEOUT <seconds>
  Sets how long a single connect() attempt waits before timing out,
  default 30.  When a hostname resolves to multiple addresses, each
  address is tried in turn, bounding total connection time by this
  value times the number of addresses tried.  Specify 0 to wait
  indefinitely.
 
SET TCP KEEPALIVE { ON, OFF }
  Setting this ON might help to detect broken connections more quickly.
  (default is ON.)
 
SET TCP LINGER { ON [timeout], OFF }
  Setting this ON ensures that a connection doesn't close before all
  outstanding data has been transferred and acknowledged.  The timeout is
  measured in 10ths of milliseconds.  The default is ON with a timeout of 0.
 
SET TCP NODELAY { ON, OFF }
  ON means send short TCP packets immediately rather than waiting
  to accumulate a bunch of them before transmitting (Nagle Algorithm).
  (default is OFF.)
 
SET TCP RECVBUF <number>
SET TCP SENDBUF <number>
   TCP receive and send buffer sizes.  (default is -1, use system defaults.)
 
These items let you tune TCP networking performance on a per-connection
basis by adjusting parameters you normally would not have access to.  You
should use these commands only if you feel that the TCP/IP protocol stack
that Kermit is using is giving you inadequate performance, and then only if
you understand the concepts (see, for example, the Comer TCP/IP books), and
then at your own risk.  These settings are displayed by SHOW NETWORK.  Not
all options are necessarily available in all Kermit versions; it depends on
the underlying TCP/IP services.
 
The following TCP and/or IP parameter(s) may also be changed:
 
SET TCP ADDRESS-FAMILY { IPV4, IPV6, AUTO }
  Selects which IP address family to use for incoming and outgoing TCP/IP
  connections (SET HOST, TELNET, FTP, and the like).  IPV4 or IPV6
  restrict connections to that family only.  AUTO, the default, lets
  Kermit try both, in the order the system resolver returns them for
  the given hostname -- typically IPv6 first if this host has working
  IPv6 connectivity, falling back to IPv4 if that fails, the same way
  ordinary Telnet clients behave.
 
SET TCP REVERSE-DNS-LOOKUP { AUTO, ON, OFF }
  Tells Kermit whether to perform reverse DNS lookup on TCP/IP connections
  so Kermit can determine the actual hostname of the host it is connected
  to, which is useful for connections to host pools, and is required for
  Kerberos connections to host pools and for incoming connections.  If the
  other host does not have a DNS entry, the reverse lookup could take a long
  time (minutes) to fail, but the connection will still be made.  Turn this
  option OFF for speedier connections if you do not need to know exactly
  which host you are connected to and you are not using Kerberos.  AUTO, the
  default, means the lookup is done on hostnames, but not on numeric IP
  addresses unless Kerberos support is installed.
 
SET TCP DNS-SERVICE-RECORDS {ON, OFF}
  Tells Kermit whether to try to use DNS SRV records to determine the
  host and port number upon which to find an advertised service.  For
  example, if a host wants regular Telnet connections redirected to some
  port other than 23, this feature allows Kermit to ask the host which
  port it should use.  Since not all domain servers are set up to answer
  such requests, this feature is OFF by default.
 
SET TCP HTTP-PROXY [<hostname or ip-address>[:<port>]]
  If a hostname or ip-address is specified, Kermit will use the Proxy
  server when attempting outgoing connections.  If no hostname or
  ip-address is specified, any previously specified Proxy server will
  be removed.  If no port number is specified, the "http" service
  will be used.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW TCP`:

```
SET TCP parameters:
 Reverse DNS lookup: automatic
 DNS Service Records lookup: off
 Keepalive: on
 Linger: off
 DontRoute: off
 Nodelay: off
 Send buffer: (default size)
 Receive buffer: (default size)
 address-family: auto
 address: (none)
 address6: (none)
 connect-timeout: 30
 http-proxy: (none)
```

### SET TELNET

Synonym: TEL

```
Syntax: SET TELNET parameter value
 
For TCP/IP TELNET connections, which are in NVT (ASCII) mode by default:
 
SET TELNET AUTHENTICATION TYPE { AUTOMATIC, KERBEROS_IV, KERBEROS_V, ...
  ..., SSL, SRP, NONE } [...]
  AUTOMATIC is the default.  Available options can vary depending on the
  features Kermit was built to support and the operating system
  configuration; type SET TELNET AUTHENTICATION TYPE ? for a list.
 
  When Kermit is the Telnet client:
    AUTOMATIC allows the host to choose the preferred type of authentication.
    NONE instructs Kermit to refuse all authentication methods when the
    authentication option is negotiated.  A list of one or more other values
    allow a specific subset of the supported authentication methods to be
    used.
 
  When Kermit is the Telnet server:
    AUTOMATIC results in available authentication methods being offered
    to the telnet client in the following order:
 
      KERBEROS_V, KERBEROS_IV, SRP, SSL, NTLM
 
  NONE results in no authentication methods being offered to the Telnet
  server when the authentication option is negotiated.  The preferred
  method of disabling authentication is:
 
    SET TELOPT /SERVER AUTHENTICATION REFUSE
 
  A list of one or more authentication methods specifies the order those
  methods are to be offered to the telnet client.
 
SET TELNET AUTHENTICATION ENCRYPT-FLAG { ANY, NONE, TELOPT }
  Use this command to specify which AUTH telopt encryption flags may be
  accepted in client mode or offered in server mode.  The default is ANY.
 
SET TELNET AUTHENTICATION HOW-FLAG { ANY, ONE-WAY, MUTUAL }
  Use this command to specify which AUTH telopt how flags may be
  accepted in client mode or offered in server mode.  The default is ANY.
 
SET TELNET BINARY-TRANSFER-MODE { ON, OFF }
  When ON (OFF by default) and BINARY negotiations are not REFUSED Kermit
  will attempt to negotiate BINARY mode in each direction before the start
  of each file transfer.  After the transfer is complete BINARY mode will
  be restored to the pre-transfer state.
 
SET TELNET BINARY-TRANSFER-MODE { ON, OFF }
  Set this command to ON if you want to force Kermit to negotiate
  Telnet Binary in both directions when performing file transfers.
  Default is OFF.  Alias SET TELNET BINARY-XFER-MODE.
 
SET TELNET BUG AUTH-KRB5-DES { ON, OFF }
  Default is ON.  Disable this bug to enable the use of encryption types
  other than DES such as 3DES or CAST-128 when the Kerberos 5 session key
  is longer than 8 bytes.
 
SET TELNET BUG BINARY-ME-MEANS-U-TOO { ON, OFF }
  Set this to ON to try to overcome TELNET binary-mode misnegotiations by
  Kermit's TELNET partner.
 
SET TELNET BUG BINARY-U-MEANS-ME-TOO { ON, OFF }
  Set this to ON to try to overcome TELNET binary-mode misnegotiations by
  Kermit's TELNET partner.
 
SET TELNET BUG INFINITE-LOOP-CHECK { ON, OFF }
  Set this to ON to prevent Kermit from responding to a telnet negotiation
  sequence that enters an infinite loop.  The default is OFF because this
  should never occur.
 
SET TELNET BUG SB-IMPLIES-WILL-DO { ON, OFF }
  Set this to ON to allow Kermit to respond to telnet sub-negotiations if
  the peer forgets to respond to WILL with DO or to DO with WILL.
 
SET TELNET DEBUG { ON, OFF }
  Set this to ON to display telnet negotiations as they are sent and
  received.
 
SET TELNET DELAY-SB { ON, OFF }
  When ON, telnet subnegotiation responses are delayed until after all
  authentication and encryption options are either successfully negotiated
  or refused. This ensures that private data is protected.  When OFF, telnet
  subnegotiation responses are sent immediately.  The default is ON.
 
SET TELNET ECHO { LOCAL, REMOTE }
  Kermit's initial echoing state for TELNET connections, LOCAL by default.
  After the connection is made, TELNET negotiations determine the echoing.
 
SET TELNET ENCRYPTION TYPE { AUTOMATIC, CAST128_CFB64, CAST128_OFB64, 
  CAST5_40_CFB64, CAST5_40_OFB64, DES_CFB64, DES_OFB64, NONE }
  AUTOMATIC allows the host to choose the preferred type of encryption.
  Other values allow a specific encryption method to be specified.
  AUTOMATIC is the default.  The list of options will vary depending
  on the encryption types selected at compilation time.
 
SET TELNET ENVIRONMENT { variable-name [ value ] }
  This feature lets Kermit send the values of certain environment variables
  to the other computer if it asks for them.  The variable-name can be any
  of the "well-known" variables "USER", "JOB", "ACCT", "PRINTER",
  "SYSTEMTYPE", or "DISPLAY".  Some Telnet servers, if given a USER
  value in this way, will accept it and therefore not prompt you for user
  name when you log in.  The default values are taken from your environment;
  use this command to change or remove them.  See RFC1572 for details.
 
SET TELNET FORWARD-X XAUTHORITY-FILE <file>
  If your X Server requires X authentication and the location of the
  .Xauthority file is not defined by the XAUTHORITY environment variable,
  use this command to specify the location of the .Xauthority file.
  
SET TELNET LOCATION [ text ]
  Location string to send to the Telnet server if it asks.  By default this
  is picked up from the LOCATION environment variable.  Give this command
  with no text to disable this feature.
 
SET TELNET NEWLINE-MODE { NVT, BINARY-MODE } { OFF, ON, RAW }
  Determines how carriage returns are handled on TELNET connections.  There
  are separate settings for NVT (ASCII) mode and binary mode.  ON (default
  for NVT mode) means CRLF represents CR.  OFF means CR followed by NUL
  represents CR.  RAW (default for BINARY mode) means CR stands for itself.
 
SET TELNET PROMPT-FOR-USERID <prompt>
  Specifies a custom prompt to be used when prompting for a userid.  Kermit
  prompts for a userid if the command:
 
    SET LOGIN USERID {}
 
  has been issued prior to a Telnet authentication negotiation for an
  authentication type that requires the transmission of a name, such as
  Secure Remote Password.
 
SET TELNET REMOTE-ECHO { ON, OFF }
  Applies only to incoming connections created with:
    SET HOST * <port> /TELNET
  This command determines whether Kermit will actually echo characters
  received from the remote when it has negotiated to do so.  The default
  is ON.  Remote echoing may be turned off when it is necessary to read
  a password with the INPUT command.
 
SET TELNET TERMINAL-TYPE name
  The terminal type to send to the remote TELNET host.  If none is given,
  your local terminal type is sent.
 
SET TELNET WAIT-FOR-NEGOTIATIONS { ON, OFF }
  Each Telnet option must be fully negotiated either On or Off before the
  session can continue.  This is especially true with options that require
  subnegotiations such as Authentication, Encryption, and Kermit; for
  proper support of these options Kermit must wait for the negotiations to
  complete.  Of course, Kermit has no way of knowing whether a reply is
  delayed or not coming at all, and so will wait a minute or more for
  required replies before continuing the session.  If you know that Kermit's
  Telnet partner will not be sending the required replies, you can set this
  option of OFF to avoid the long timeouts.  Or you can instruct Kermit to
  REFUSE specific options with the SET TELOPT command.

### SET TEL

Synonym for [SET TELNET](#set-telnet).

### SET TELOPT

```
SET TELOPT [ { /CLIENT, /SERVER } ] <option> -
    { ACCEPTED, REFUSED, REQUESTED, REQUIRED } -
    [ { ACCEPTED, REFUSED, REQUESTED, REQUIRED } ]
  SET TELOPT lets you specify policy requirements for Kermit's handling of
  Telnet option negotiations.  Setting an option REQUIRED causes Kermit
  to offer the option to the peer and disconnect if the option is refused.
  REQUESTED causes Kermit to offer an option to the peer.  ACCEPTED results
  in no offer but Kermit will attempt to negotiate the option if it is
  requested.  REFUSED instructs Kermit to refuse the option if it is
  requested by the peer.
 
  Some options are negotiated in two directions and accept separate policies
  for each direction; the first keyword applies to Kermit itself, the second
  applies to Kermit's Telnet partner; if the second keyword is omitted, an
  appropriate (option-specific) default is applied.  You can also include a
  /CLIENT or /SERVER switch to indicate whether the given policies apply
  when Kermit is the Telnet client or the Telnet server; if no switch is
  given, the command applies to the client.
 
  Note that some of Kermit's Telnet partners fail to refuse options that
  they do not recognize and instead do not respond at all.  In this case it
  is possible to use SET TELOPT to instruct Kermit to REFUSE the option
  before connecting to the problem host, thus skipping the problematic
  negotiation.
 
  Use SHOW TELOPT to view current Telnet Option negotiation settings.
  SHOW TELNET displays current Telnet settings.

```

### SET TEMP-DIRECTORY

Synonym: TMP-DIRECTORY

```
Syntax: SET TEMP-DIRECTORY [ <directory-name> ]
  Tells Kermit to use the given directory for creating temporary files.
  These are used (for example) in FTP downloads and by the CHANGE command.
  If you don't issue this command, C-Kermit picks a directory automatically
  based on the operating system and any environment variables you might have
  set.  Use SHOW TEMP-DIRECTORY or SHOW VARIABLE \v(tmpdir) to see Kermit's
  current temporary directory setting.  Synonym: SET TMP-DIRECTORY.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW TEMP-DIRECTORY`:

```
 /tmp/
```

### SET TMP-DIRECTORY

Synonym for [SET TEMP-DIRECTORY](#set-temp-directory).

### SET TERMINAL

```
Syntax: SET TERMINAL parameter value
 
SET TERMINAL TYPE ...
  This command is not available because this version of Kermit does not
  include a terminal emulator.  Instead, it is a "semitransparent pipe"
  (or a totally transparent one, if you configure it that way) to the
  computer or service you have made a connection to.  Your console,
  workstation window, or the terminal emulator or terminal from which you
  are running Kermit provides the emulation.
 
SET TERMINAL APC { ON, OFF, NO-INPUT, UNCHECKED, UNCHECKED-NO-INPUT }
  Controls execution of Application Program Commands sent by the host while
  C-Kermit is in CONNECT mode.  ON allows execution of "safe" commands and
  disallows potentially dangerous commands such as DELETE, RENAME, OUTPUT,
  and RUN.  OFF prevents execution of APCs.  UNCHECKED allows execution of
  all APCs.  OFF is the default.
 
SET TERMINAL AUTODOWNLOAD { ON, OFF, ERROR { STOP, CONTINUE } }
  Enables/disables automatic switching into file-transfer mode when a valid
  Kermit or ZMODEM packet of the appropriate type is received during CONNECT
  mode.  Default is ON.
 
  When TERMINAL AUTODOWNLOAD is ON, the TERMINAL AUTODOWNLOAD ERROR setting
  tells what to do if an error occurs during a file transfer or other
  protocol operation initiated by the terminal emulator: STOP means to
  remain in command mode so you can see what happened; CONTINUE (the
  default) means to resume the CONNECT session (e.g. so a far-end script
  can continue its work).  Either way, a one-line status is printed first.
 
SET TERMINAL BYTESIZE { 7, 8 }
  Use 7- or 8-bit characters between Kermit and the remote computer during
  terminal sessions.  The default is 8.
 
SET TERMINAL CHARACTER-SET <remote-cs> [ <local-cs> ]
  Specifies the character set used by the remote host, <remote-cs>, and the
  character set used by C-Kermit locally, <local-cs>.  If you don't specify
  the local character set, the current FILE CHARACTER-SET is used.  When
  you specify two different character sets, C-Kermit translates between them
  during CONNECT.  By default, both character sets are TRANSPARENT, and
  no translation is done.
 
SET TERMINAL CR-DISPLAY { CRLF, NORMAL }
  Specifies how incoming carriage return characters are to be displayed
  on your screen.
 
SET TERMINAL DEBUG { ON, OFF }
  Turns terminal session debugging on and off.  When ON, incoming control
  characters are displayed symbolically, rather than be taken as formatting
  commands.  SET TERMINAL DEBUG ON implies SET TELNET DEBUG ON.
 
SET TERMINAL ECHO { LOCAL, REMOTE }
  Specifies which side does the echoing during terminal connection.
 
SET TERMINAL ESCAPE-CHARACTER { ENABLED, DISABLED }
  Turns on/off the ability to escape back from CONNECT mode using the SET
  ESCAPE character.  If you disable it, Kermit returns to its prompt only
  when the connection is closed by the other end.  USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION.
  Also see HELP SET ESCAPE.
 
SET TERMINAL HEIGHT <number>
  Tells C-Kermit how many rows (lines) are on your CONNECT-mode screen.
 
SET TERMINAL IDLE-TIMEOUT <number>
  Sets the limit on idle time in CONNECT mode to the given number of
  seconds.  0 (the default) means no limit.
 
SET TERMINAL IDLE-ACTION { EXIT, HANGUP, OUTPUT [ text ], RETURN }
  Specifies the action to be taken when a CONNECT session is idle for the
  number of seconds given by SET TERMINAL IDLE-TIMEOUT.  The default action
  is to RETURN to command mode.  EXIT exits from Kermit; HANGUP hangs up the
  connection, and OUTPUT sends the given text to the host without leaving
  CONNECT mode; if no text is given a NUL (0) character is sent.
 
SET TERMINAL IDLE-ACTION { TELNET-NOP, TELNET-AYT }
  For TELNET connections only: Sends the indicated Telnet protocol message:
  No Operation (NOP) or "Are You There?" (AYT).
 
SET TERMINAL LF-DISPLAY { CRLF, NORMAL }
  Specifies how incoming linefeed characters are to be displayed
  on your screen.
 
SET TERMINAL LOCKING-SHIFT { OFF, ON }
  Tells Kermit whether to use Shift-In/Shift-Out (Ctrl-O and Ctrl-N) to
  switch between 7-bit and 8-bit characters during CONNECT.  OFF by default.
 
SET TERMINAL NEWLINE-MODE { OFF, ON }
  Tells whether to send CRLF (Carriage Return and Line Feed) when you type
  CR (press the Return or Enter key) in CONNECT mode.
 
SET TERMINAL PRINT { ON, OFF }
  Enables and disables host-initiated transparent printing in CONNECT mode.
 
SET TERMINAL TRIGGER <string>
  Specifies a string that, when detected during any subsequent CONNECT
  session, is to cause automatic return to command mode.  Give this command
  without a string to cancel the current trigger.  See HELP CONNECT for
  additional information.
 
SET TERMINAL WIDTH <number>
 Tells Kermit how many columns (characters) are on your CONNECT-mode screen.
 
Type SHOW TERMINAL to see current terminal settings.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW TERMINAL`:

```
Terminal parameters:
   Bytesize: Command: 8 bits              Terminal: 8 bits

```

### SET TRANSACTION-LOG

```
Syntax: SET TRANSACTION-LOG { BRIEF, FTP, VERBOSE }
  Selects the transaction-log format; BRIEF and FTP have one line per file;
  FTP is compatible with FTP log.  VERBOSE (the default) has more info.
```

### SET TRANSFER

Synonym: XFER

```
Syntax: SET TRANSFER (or XFER) parameter value
 
Choices:
 
SET TRANSFER BELL { OFF, ON }
  Whether to ring the terminal bell at the end of a file transfer.
 
SET TRANSFER CANCELLATION { OFF, ON [ <code> [ <number> ] ] }
  OFF disables remote-mode packet-mode cancellation from the keyboard.
  ON enables it.  The optional <code> is the control character to use for
  cancellation; the optional <number> is how many consecutive occurrences
  of the given control character are required for cancellation.
 
SET TRANSFER INTERRUPTION { ON, OFF }
  TRANSFER INTERRUPTION is normally ON, allowing for interruption of a file
  transfer in progress by typing certain characters while the file-transfer
  display is active.  SET TRANSFER INTERRUPTION OFF disables interruption
  of file transfer from the keyboard in local mode.
 
SET TRANSFER CRC-CALCULATION { OFF, ON }
  Tells whether Kermit should accumulate a Cyclic Redundancy Check for 
  each file transfer.  Normally ON, in which case the CRC value is available
  in the \v(crc16) variable after the transfer.  Adds some overhead.  Use
  SET TRANSFER CRC OFF to disable.
 
SET TRANSFER CHARACTER-SET name
  Selects the character set used to represent textual data in Kermit
  packets.  Text characters are translated to/from the FILE CHARACTER-SET.
  Choices:
 
  TRANSPARENT (no translation, the default)
  ASCII
  LATIN1 (ISO 8859-1 Latin Alphabet 1)
  LATIN2 (ISO 8859-2 Latin Alphabet 2)
  LATIN9 (ISO 8859-15 Latin Alphabet 9)
  CYRILLIC-ISO (ISO 8859-5 Latin/Cyrillic)
  GREEK-ISO (ISO 8859-7 Latin/Greek)
  HEBREW-ISO (ISO 8859-8 Latin/Hebrew)
  JAPANESE-EUC (JIS X 0208 Kanji + Roman and Katakana)
  UCS-2 (ISO 10646 / Unicode 2-byte form)
  UTF-8 (ISO 10646 / Unicode 8-bit serialized transformation format)
 
SET TRANSFER TRANSLATION { ON, OFF }
  Enables and disables file-transfer character-set translation.  It's
  enabled by default.
 
SET TRANSFER DISPLAY { BRIEF, CRT, FULLSCREEN, NONE, SERIAL }
  Choose the desired format for the progress report to be displayed on
  your screen during file transfers when Kermit is in local mode.
  FULLSCREEN requires your terminal type be set correctly; the others
  are independent of terminal type.
 
SET TRANSFER LOCKING-SHIFT { OFF, ON, FORCED }
  Tell whether locking-shift protocol should be used during file transfer
  to achieve 8-bit transparency on a 7-bit connection.  ON means to request
  its use if PARITY is not NONE and to use it if the other Kermit agrees,
  OFF means not to use it, FORCED means to use it even if the other Kermit
  does not agree.
 
SET TRANSFER MODE { AUTOMATIC, MANUAL }
  Automatic (the default) means Kermit should automatically go into binary
  file-transfer mode and use literal filenames if the other Kermit says it
  has a compatible file system, e.g. UNIX-to-UNIX, but not UNIX-to-DOS.
  Also, when sending files, Kermit should switch between binary and text
  mode automatically per file based on the SET FILE BINARY-PATTERNS and SET
  FILE TEXT-PATTERNS.
 
SET TRANSFER PIPES { ON, OFF }
  Enables/Disables automatic sending from / reception to command pipes when
  the incoming filename starts with '!'.  Also see CSEND, CRECEIVE.
 
SET TRANSFER PROTOCOL { KERMIT, XMODEM, ... }
  Synonym for SET PROTOCOL (q.v.).
 
SET TRANSFER REPORT { ON, OFF }
  Enables/Disables the automatic post-transfer message telling what files
  went where from C-Kermit when it is in remote mode.  ON by default.
 
SET TRANSFER SLOW-START { OFF, ON }
  ON (the default) tells Kermit, when sending files, to gradually build up
  the packet length to the maximum negotiated length.  OFF means start
  sending the maximum length right away.
 
Synonym: SET XFER.  Use SHOW TRANSFER (XFER) to see SET TRANSFER values.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW TRANSFER`:

```
 Transfer Bell: on
 Transfer Interruption: on
 Transfer Cancellation: on
 Transfer Translation:  on
 Transfer Character-set: Transparent

SET TRANSMIT EOF text
  Text to send after end of file is reached, e.g. \4 for Ctrl-D
 
SET TRANSMIT FILL number
  ASCII value of a character to insert into blank lines, 0 for none.
  Applies only to text mode.  0 by default.
 
SET TRANSMIT LINEFEED { ON, OFF }

  Normally, only CR  is sent.
 
SET TRANSMIT LOCKING-SHIFT { ON, OFF }
  Whether to use SO/SI for transmitting 8-bit data when PARITY is not NONE.
 
SET TRANSMIT PAUSE number
  How many milliseconds to pause after transmitting each line (text mode),
  or each character (binary mode).
 
SET TRANSMIT PROMPT number
  ASCII value of character to look for from host before sending next line
  when TRANSMITting in text mode; normally 10 (Linefeed).  0 means none;
  don't wait for a prompt.
 
SET TRANSMIT TIMEOUT number
  Number of seconds to wait for each character to echo when TRANSMIT ECHO
  is ON or TRANSMIT PROMPT is not 0.  If 0 is specified, this means wait
  indefinitely for each echo.
 
Synonym: SET XMIT.  SHOW TRANSMIT displays current settings.
```

Compile-time default, from `SHOW TRANSMIT`:

```

### SET XMIT

Synonym for [SET TRANSMIT](#set-transmit).

### SET UNKNOWN-CHAR-SET

```
Syntax: SET UNKNOWN-CHAR-SET action
  DISCARD (default) means reject any arriving files encoded in unknown
  character sets.  KEEP means to accept them anyway.
```

### SET VARIABLE-EVALUATION

```
Syntax: SET VARIABLE-EVALUATION { RECURSIVE, SIMPLE }
  Tells Kermit weather to evaluate \%x and \&x[] variables recursively
  In C-Kermit 10.0 the default is SIMPLE, meaning variables return their
  values like in any other programming language, making life much easier
  when those values happen to be Windows or DOS pathnames, which contain
  backslashes.
```

### SET WILDCARD-EXPANSION

```
Syntax: SET WILDCARD-EXPANSION { KERMIT [ switch ], SHELL, ON, OFF }
  KERMIT (the default) means C-Kermit expands filename wildcards in SEND and
  similar commands itself, and in incoming GET commands.  Optional switches
  are /NO-MATCH-DOT-FILES ("*" and "?" should not match an initial
  period in a filename; this is the default) and /MATCH-DOT-FILES if you
  want files whose names begin with "." included.  SET WILDCARD SHELL
  means that Kermit asks your preferred shell to expand wildcards (this
  should not be necessary in C-Kermit 7.0 and later).  HELP WILDCARD for
  further information.
 
  The ON and OFF choices allow you to disable and renable wildcard
  processing independent of the KERMIT / SHELL choice.  Disabling wildcards
  allows you to process an array or list of filenames without having to
  consider whether the names might contain literal wildcard characters.
  WARNING: SET WILD OFF also disables internal filename pattern-matching,
  used (for example) in creating backup files.
```

### SET WINDOW-SIZE

Synonyms: W, WI, WIN

```
Syntax: SET WINDOW-SIZE number
  Specifies number of slots for sliding windows, i.e. the number of packets
  that can be transmitted before waiting for acknowledgement.  The default
  is one, the maximum is 32.  Increased window size might result in reduced
  maximum packet length.  Use sliding windows for improved efficiency on
  connections with long delays.  A full duplex connection is required, as
  well as a cooperating Kermit on the other end.
```

## FILE Subcommands

### FILE CLOSE

```
Syntax: FILE CLOSE <channel>
  Closes the file on the given channel if it was open.
  Also see HELP FILE OPEN.  Synonym: FCLOSE.
```

### FILE COUNT

```
Syntax: FILE COUNT [ { /BYTES, /LINES, /LIST, /NOLIST } ] <channel>
  If the channel is open, this command prints the nubmer of bytes (default)
  or lines in the file if at top level or if /LIST is included; if /NOLIST
  is given, the result is not printed.  In all cases the result is assigned
  to \v(f_count).  Synonym: FCOUNT
```

### FILE FLUSH

```
Syntax: FILE FLUSH <channel>
  Flushes output buffers on the given channel if it was open, forcing
  all material previously written to be committed to disk.  Synonym: FFLUSH.
  Also available as \F_flush().
```

### FILE LIST

```
Syntax: FILE LIST
  Lists the channel number, name, modes, and position of each file opened
  with FILE OPEN.  Synonym: FLIST.
```

### FILE OPEN

```
Syntax: FILE OPEN [ switches ] <variable> <filename>
  Opens the file indicated by <filename> in the mode indicated by the
  switches, if any, or if no switches are included, in read-only mode, and
  assigns a channel number for the file to the given variable.
  Synonym: FOPEN.  Switches:
 
/READ
  Open the file for reading.
 
/STDIN
  Tells Kermit to read from Standard Input.  In this case you don't specify
  a filename.
 
/STDOUT
  Tells Kermit to write to Standard Output.  In this case you don't specify
  a filename.
 
/STDERR
  Tells Kermit to write to Standard Error.  In this case you don't specify
  a filename.
 
/WRITE
  Open the file for writing.  If /READ was not also specified, this creates
  a new file.  If /READ was specified, the existing file is preserved, but
  writing is allowed.  In both cases, the read/write pointer is initially
  at the beginning of the file.
 
/APPEND
  If the file does not exist, create a new file and open it for writing.
  If the file exists, open it for writing, but with the write pointer
  positioned at the end.
 
/BINARY
  This option is ignored in UNIX.
 
Switches can be combined in an way that makes sense and is supported by the
underlying operating system.
```

### FILE READ

```
Syntax: FILE READ [ switches ] <channel> [ <variable> ]
  Reads data from the file on the given channel number into the <variable>,
  if one was given; if no variable was given, the result is printed on
  the screen.  The variable should be a macro name rather than a \%x
  variable or array element if you want backslash characters in the file to
  be taken literally.  Synonym: FREAD.  Switches:
 
/LINE
  Specifies that a line of text is to be read.  A line is defined according
  to the underlying operating system's text-file format.  For example, in
  UNIX a line is a sequence of characters up to and including a linefeed.
  The line terminator (if any) is removed before assigning the text to the
  variable.  If no switches are included with the FILE READ command, /LINE
  is assumed.
 
/SIZE:number
  Specifies that the given number of bytes (characters) is to be read.
  This gives a semblance of "record i/o" for files that do not necessarily
  contain lines.  The resulting block of characters is assigned to the
  variable without any editing.
 
/CHARACTER
  Equivalent to /SIZE:1.  If FILE READ /CHAR succeeds but the <variable> is
  empty, this indicates a NUL byte was read.
 
/TRIM
  Trims trailing whitespace from the right when used with /LINE.  Ignored
  if used with /CHAR or /SIZE.
 
/UNTABIFY
  Tells Kermit to convert tabs to spaces (assuming tabs set every 8 spaces)
  when used with /LINE.  Ignored if used with /CHAR or /SIZE.
 
Synonym: FREAD.
Also available as \F_getchar(), \F_getline(), \F_getblock().
```

### FILE REWIND

```
Syntax: FILE REWIND <channel>
  If the channel is open, moves the read/write pointer to the beginning of
  the file.  Equivalent to FILE SEEK <channel> 0.  Synonym: FREWIND.
  Also available as \F_rewind().
```

### FILE SEEK

```
Syntax: FILE SEEK [ switches ] <channel> { [{+,-}]<number>, EOF }
  Switches are /BYTE, /LINE, /RELATIVE, /ABSOLUTE, and /FIND:pattern.
  Moves the file pointer for this file to the given position in the
  file.  Subsequent FILE READs or WRITEs will take place at that position.
  If neither the /RELATIVE nor /ABSOLUTE switch is given, an unsigned
  <number> is absolute; a signed number is relative.  EOF means to move to
  the end of the file.  If a /FIND: switch is included, Kermit seeks to the
  specified spot (e.g. 0 for the beginning) and then begins searching line
  by line for the first line that matches the given pattern.  To start
  searching from the current file position specify a line number of +0.
  To start searching from the line after the current one, use +1 (etc).
  Synonym: FSEEK.
```

### FILE STATUS

```
Syntax: FILE STATUS <channel>
  If the channel is open, this command shows the name of the file, the
  switches it was opened with, and the current read/write position.
  Synonym: FSTATUS
```

### FILE WRITE

```
FILE WRITE [ switches ] <channel> <text>
  Writes the given text to the file on the given channel number.  The <text>
  can be literal text or a variable, or any combination.  If the text might
  contain leading or trailing spaces, it must be enclosed in braces if you
  want to preserve them.  Synonym: FWRITE.  Switches:
 
/LINE
  Specifies that an appropriate line terminator is to be added to the
  end of the <text>.  If no switches are included, /LINE is assumed.
 
/SIZE:number
  Specifies that the given number of bytes (characters) is to be written.
  If the given <text> is longer than the requested size, it is truncated;
  if is shorter, it is padded according /LPAD and /RPAD switches.  Synonym:
  /BLOCK.
 
/LPAD[:value]
  If /SIZE was given, but the <text> is shorter than the requested size,
  the text is padded on the left with sufficient copies of the character
  whose ASCII value is given to write the given length.  If no value is
  specified, 32 (the code for Space) is used.  The value can also be 0 to
  write the indicated number of NUL bytes.  If /SIZE was not given, this
  switch is ignored.
 
/RPAD[:value]
  Like LPAD, but pads on the right.
 
/STRING
  Specifies that the <text> is to be written as-is, with no terminator added.
 
/CHARACTER
  Specifies that one character should be written.  If the <text> is empty or
  not given, a NUL character is written; otherwise the first character of
  <text> is given.
 
Synonym FWRITE.
Also available as \F_putchar(), \F_putline(), \F_putblock().

  already exists, it is recycled; if no array is specified, the count is
  returned but no array is created.  All arguments are optional
  (\fsplit() with no arguments returns 0).
 
  The BREAK SET is the set of all characters that separate words. The
  default break set is all characters except ASCII letters and digits.
  ASCII (C0) control characters are treated as break characters by default,
  as are spacing and punctuation characters, brackets, and so on, and

  default include set is empty.  Three special symbolic include sets are
  also allowed:
 
    ALL (meaning include all bytes that are not in the break set)
    CSV (special treatment for Comma-Separated-Value records)
    TSV (special treatment for Tab-Separated-Value records)
 
  For operating on 8-bit character sets, the include set should be ALL.

  quotes or brackets selected by the sum of the following:
 
     1 = doublequotes:    "a b c"
     2 = braces:          {a b c}
     4 = apostrophes:     'a b c'
     8 = parentheses:     (a b c)

    nonzero case requests a case-sensitive comparison.
    The optional start and length arguments apply to both s1 and s2
    and allow specification of substrings if it is not desired to compare
    the whole strings.  Results for non-ASCII strings are implentation-
    and locale-dependent.
