#   and SSL is one of the auth types on offer, so the two ends go off
#   and negotiate an SSL-authenticated session instead of the plain
#   Telnet connection these tests mean to exercise.
#
# - KERMIT (option 47, RFC 2840): both ends mutually request it by

#   (tn_wait()/tn_siks() in ckctel.c) on top of the ordinary option

# delays, but refusing them together with KERMIT was tried and broke
# Zmodem-over-telnet, rz/sz's handshake bytes never reaching the other side.

# behind evidently matters to the raw 8-bit-clean path Zmodem depends on with no

def zmodem_remote(request, wermit_path, get_free_port, spawn_wermit):
    """
    Provides a way to run the wermit-under-test (Zmodem tests' local side)
    against a rz/sz remote, parameterized over three ways of reaching it:

    - "pty": the far end of SET HOST /NETWORK-TYPE:PSEUDOTERMINAL is a second
      wermit process, not rz/sz directly.

      The far-end wermit is exec'd with a script and no explicit SET LINE or SET
      HOST; a wermit invoked this way (as the target of another process's SET
      HOST /NETWORK-TYPE:PSEUDOTERMINAL) treats its controlling tty (the pty
      slave it was exec'd onto) as its connection by default, so SET PROTOCOL
      ZMODEM plus SEND or RECEIVE runs directly over it with nothing else
      needed.

    - "tcp-raw"/"tcp-telnet": a second, plain wermit process (the remote)
      reaches the wermit-under-test over a real TCP/IP connection, using SET
      HOST's /RAW-SOCKET or /TELNET protocol-switch respectively. It doesn't use
      Kermit's SERVER mode.

      This matters for Zmodem in particular because rz/sz's binary data
      (including 0xFF bytes) is piped directly over the connection with no
      Kermit-level framing, so under "tcp-telnet" it depends entirely on the
      Telnet layer's IAC byte-stuffing and BINARY negotiation to survive intact.

      To actually run rz/sz, the remote uses SET PROTOCOL ZMODEM plus SEND or
      RECEIVE, which is Kermit's mechanism for redirecting an external protocol
      over the current connection.  It forks rz/sz onto a pty of its
      choosing and relays that to the connection. This is exactly the same
      mechanism the wermit under test already uses for SEND with a
      non-Kermit protocol, so it needs no special handling on the test's part.
      It's the same as a real remote BBS/modem host execing rz/sz onto the line
      it's already connected to, just automated by Kermit instead of by hand.

      The remote is spawned via spawn_wermit with its console discarded.  Unlike
      the wermit under test, it doesn't need a real tty, and giving it an unread
      pty instead of discarding its output would risk deadlock on large
      transfers once its progress messages fill the pty's kernel buffer with
      nothing draining it.

    Returns a callable:
        zmodem_remote(remote_argv, cmd_str, cwd, timeout=45,
                      debug_log=None)
    where remote_argv is the rz/sz command as a list (e.g.
    ["sz", str(src_file)] or ["rz"]), and cmd_str is the
    wermit-under-test's command string with a literal "{HOST}"
    placeholder standing in for the "set host" target.

    Returns (returncode, stdout) like run_wermit_pty. The
    callable also exposes zmodem_remote.mode ("pty" or "tcp") so
    callers can pad timeouts for the extra TCP connection setup.
