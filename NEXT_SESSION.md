# Next session

Handoff for the Victor 9000 port, written 9 August 2026, revised after
§16ah and then again at the desk the same day, again on 10 August after
§16ao, and again on 11 August after §16aq and then §16ar, and again on
15 August after §16av, and again on 17 August after §16ax and then §16ay,
and again on **21 August after §16bc, the first bench sitting since 12
August**.
**No live defect in the receive path.** §16af closed the last one.
**One live defect elsewhere: the transfer display cannot be used at 38400
on FreeDOS for Victor — §16bc, item 17.**

---

## §16bc: the machine sees six MAME-only sittings, and the port is unmoved

**20–21 August 2026, on the real Victor 9000.** Thirteen H-series legs over
three passes (`HW_TEST_16bc.md`, written before any leg ran; counters in
`v9k/legs/STEPH*.OUT` and `v9k/legs/HP.LOG`; photographs in
`screenshots/stephh IMG_203[2-5].png`). **No code change, no upstream edit
— still twenty-two.** Nine transfers byte-exact.

**1. The regression passed and that was the point.** The machine had not
seen this port since §16au; in between it took upstream 11.0.508, edits
19–22 and §16av's six fixes, all measured at 9600 under MAME only, and
**38400 is hardware-only**. Leg HA: **26.200 s / 1,250 cps against §16aq's
25.65x / 1,277**, `rxlost=0 rxfull=0`, 0/0/0 — **+0.54 s, inside the
bench's 0.4–1.3 s spread.** Leg HB sent 32 KB by name at **1,467 cps
against leg CC's 1,475, 117 ms apart.**

**2. Five edits confirmed on hardware for the first time.** 19 (dates: the
server listed a file at the minute it was staged), 20 (`REMOTE SPACE` from
INT 21h), 22 (`mail` A packet ACKed with refusal code `N`, no data
packets), **21 (both `znewn()` branches: originals untouched,
`RCVHK.001`/`HK.001` written, no E packet, no silent overwrite)**, and
**15** — the 443K parser build read `SET SPEED 38400` back as 38400 on the
machine, with 12, 13, 14 and `mode: local` in the same leg. **Item 7 is
closed.**

**3. Flow control: the null is STRUCTURAL and is now properly measured.**
Leg HD, with a far end that can genuinely stop, still reports **`held=0
rel=0`** — `rxpeak` 2,635 against a high mark of 3,072, **the mark was
never crossed.** At 38400 with a window of 1 the ring cannot reach 3/4
because the far end stops for an ACK first (§16au's regime fact, third
direction). **`V9K_FLOW` stays `FLO_NONE`.** See item 11 for what is left.

**4. §16bb's `POSIX_CRTSCTS` claim was WRONG and is retracted.** A plain
`make macosx` reports `CK_RTSCTS` only; `ckcdeb.h:4583` hands the symbol
out per platform and **Darwin is not in the list**, though macOS has had
`CRTSCTS` for years. **`make macosx KFLAGS=-DPOSIX_CRTSCTS`**, and verify
it with **`strings wermit | grep "tthflow POSIX_CRTSCTS tcsetattr"`** —
`SHOW FEATURES` only proves the symbol was defined while `ckuus5.c`
compiled. The client lives in **`~/projects/ckermit-host`** (copy
`*.c *.h makefile` **and `ckcpro.w`**).

**5. FreeDOS for Victor runs on real silicon and is the fastest this port
has been.** `dos oem=fd ver=622 irq1=09` — §16av's branch, first execution
on hardware. Leg HG at **38400 on channel B: 1,412–1,438 cps over two
passes, 0 damaged / 0 timeouts / 0 resends**, 13–15% faster than MS-DOS 3.1
on the same machine in the same hour. **Item 14 is closed.**

**6. The `A:\` stall is `zchko()` creating and deleting a file.** Legs
HL/HN — identical wire bytes, one variable — put it at **4.404 s (host)
and 4.50 s (Victor)**, with `dec max` **450 on `A:` at both 9600 and 38400
and on a third leg, against 100 on `D:`**. Leg HP's debug log shows
`gtimer` jumping **+5 s between the F packet and its ACK**, and inside it:
**four stats, one file CREATE and one file DELETE**, per received file,
before a data byte moves. `ckufio.c`'s `zchko()` opens the file
`O_WRONLY|O_CREAT` purely to call `isatty()` on it, then deletes it —
**its own comment opens "NOTE: The design is flawed."** Cheap on POSIX,
expensive on a 156-entry FAT root. **Not a port defect; report-upstream,
item 8.** §16ba's ~27 s was the emulator's image, not the machine.

**7. Four harness lessons, three of which cost legs.** A leg with no
redirect is **not** a leg with no counters — the exit report is on the
screen too, and one photograph turned HH into a measurement (§16u, §16az
FDG and §16ba all lost legs to the opposite assumption). A `-d` flag with
no binary behind it is a suggestion, **and this sheet quoted that rule
while breaking it** — `STEPHP.BAT` passed `-d` to a `NODEBUG` binary and
HP's host files were never written at all. **A conclusion drawn from absent
files is not a measurement**: pass 1's "`D:` does not persist writes" was
retracted by pass 2 writing to `D:` without trouble — the common factor was
the image swap and no leg ever separated them; what survives is that **§0
should round-trip a WRITE, not only a read.** And within-sitting is tight
where cross-sitting is worthless: pass 2's four 38400 receives took the
identical 1 timeout / 2 resends and spread **73 ms**.

---

## §16bb: file collision on FAT, the MAIL disposition, and text mode

**19 August 2026, no Victor in reach.** Seven MAME legs at 9600 on
MS-DOS 3.1, everything on `D:` (`HW_TEST_16bb.md`, written before any leg
ran; counters in `v9k/legs/STEPM*.OUT`). **Upstream edits 21 and 22, both
agreed before being written — the count is twenty-two.** DGROUP **48,896
(74%), unchanged**; image 231,172; **needs 243,236 (237K), smallest Victor
384K, unchanged**; warnings 18 → 19 (the new one is the `tlog()` edit 22
makes live, `W111`, same shape as the ten already there); `ckvictor.c`
still 0. `KEEP_ICP` still links, DGROUP 59,632 (90%) unchanged, 443K.
Proofs 5 of 5. Control binary md5 `d76c10b2…`, **bit-identical to the one
§16ay and §16ba ran**.

**1. `--safe-server` was not safe, and the way it failed is the finding.**
`ckcpro.c:503` forces FILE COLLISION to RENAME on any server with DELETE
disabled; RENAME goes through `znewn()`, which appends `".~<n>~"` to a name
that already has an extension. Leg MA measured what that did, and the two
`znewn()` branches — chosen by the LENGTH of the target name, because
`CKMAXNAM` is 16 here — fail differently:

- **4-char target** → `D:\MA.D.~1~`, DOS refuses it, **E packet with empty
  text before any data**, existing file survives.
- **9-char target** → branch B's `sprintf` lands past the string's own
  terminator, the name comes back UNCHANGED, and the server **silently
  overwrites the existing file** — the exact thing the forced RENAME
  exists to prevent, with no counter, log line or packet saying so.

**Edit 21** hands the job to `v9k_backupname()` (`RCVMB.DAT` →
`RCVMB.001`), which probes for the first free number rather than expanding
a wildcard — the pattern upstream expands describes a name FAT cannot
contain, so its own uniqueness scan was blind and a fix that kept it would
have collided with the previous backup. Leg MB: all four sends OK, no E
packet, **originals untouched, both new files renamed**. Leg MC is BACKUP
(`coll=2`) and comes out **the other way round**, which is the point of
running both: `RCVMC.001` holds the OLD file and `RCVMC.DAT` the new one.

**And `REMOTE STATUS` ran for the first time** (leg MG, the 11.0.508
client): it answers, `16`/`128` are `CKMAXNAM`/`CKMAXPATH`, and **four
fields come back empty** — Hostname, Server hardware, OS family, and
`Current directory on server`, which is blank while `REMOTE PWD` in the
same leg answers `D:`. Small new open item, only visible now that a client
that can ask exists.

**2. `NOFRILLS` compiled out the MAIL refusal and left the acceptance.**
`gattr()`'s `case 'M'` was guarded and `case 'P'`, eight lines below, was
not — §16ax saw it from the far end. **Edit 22**, guarded with `VICTOR9K`
by decision (same call as 19).

**3. Text mode ran for the first time in this port's life, and it is
correct.** Leg MH: a Unix LF file sent in text mode lands on the Victor as
**2,240 bytes, CR 40 / LF 40** — a proper DOS text file — and the binary
arm (MF) preserves the 2,200 LF-only bytes exactly. So `#undef NLCHAR` +
`_fmode = O_BINARY` is the right pair, measured rather than argued. The
mechanism is not the obvious one: **the Victor converts nothing in either
direction.** It gets a correct DOS file because CRLF is *both* the Kermit
wire format and the DOS file format, so the sender's conversion is the
only one needed and raw pass-through is exactly right.

**The first attempt tested nothing and the failure is the reusable part.**
MF's A packet carries `B8` — **binary** — because this Mac runs `transfer
mode automatic`, which overrode `set file type text`. Its own precondition
was never checked. **The A packet carries the file-type attribute and the
packet log already records it: read it before believing a text-mode
claim.** MF's second flaw would have hidden the first anyway — it compared
a GET round trip, and **for a GET the sender decides the mode**, so
text-out/text-back is lossless whatever either end does. The observable
that does not lie is the file on the image, read with `vtg_image_util`.

**One non-conformance, predicted in advance and confirmed**:
server-generated text (`REMOTE STATUS`, `REMOTE HELP`, listings) goes out
with **bare LF** — leg MG's stream is 38 `#J` and zero `#M` — because those
strings are built with `\n` in C and the LF→CRLF conversion at
`ckcfns.c:2829` is gated on `feol`. Invisible against a Unix client;
a property of the platform pair (OS/2 undefines `NLCHAR` too), not of
either edit. Left alone.

**4. The harness produced two lessons and one of them cost a leg.** A leg
ends **when MAME exits, not when the host does** — MAME holds the
single-use `-bitb` socket for the whole of `-seconds_to_run`, and starting
the next leg on the host's completion put two emulators on one listener
and voided the first MB. And this sitting's legs were first written as
NA–NG, which **collided with §16av's**; three tracked `.BAT` files were
overwritten and restored from git. **`git ls-files | grep STEP` belongs in
every run sheet's §0** beside `vtg_image_util info`.

**5. A reading corrected mid-sitting.** The F-packet ACK does **not**
report the name the server chose — `ckcpro.w:1546` sends `fspec`, which
`rcvfil()` fills from the incoming name *before* the collision switch. Leg
MB proves it directly: its ACKs say `rcvmb.dat` while the file on disk is
`RCVMB.001`. **The disk is the observable for a collision leg; the ACK is
not.** The treatment leg corrected the control leg's reading, which is an
argument for running both even when the control's answer looks obvious.

**6. The bench Mac now has a C-Kermit 11.0.508 client** — built 21 August
in **`~/projects/ckermit-host`**, a sibling directory outside the repo,
because `make macosx` drops `wermit` and ~100 `.o` into the working
directory alongside `ckermitw.exe`. Copy `*.c *.h makefile` **and
`ckcpro.w`** (the makefile regenerates `ckcpro.c` with `wart` and stops
without it). It has `REMOTE STATUS`, which 9.0.302 does not, and the 2014
`remcfm()` fix §16ax lost five commands to.

**CORRECTION, 21 August: `make macosx` does NOT report `POSIX_CRTSCTS`,
and the §16bb claim that it does is WRONG.** `ckcdeb.h:4583` hands that
symbol out per platform — BSDI, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, BeBOX, IRIX52 —
and **Darwin is not on the list**, though macOS's `<sys/termios.h>:218`
defines `CRTSCTS` as `CCTS_OFLOW|CRTS_IFLOW` and has for years. A plain
build reports `CK_RTSCTS` alone, which is §16am's exact trap: it only makes
`SET FLOW RTS/CTS` a legal command. **`make macosx KFLAGS=-DPOSIX_CRTSCTS`
is the fix**, and it is verified two ways — `SHOW FEATURES` lists the
symbol, and `strings wermit` finds `tthflow POSIX_CRTSCTS tcsetattr`, which
is inside the `#ifdef` in `ckutio.c` and proves the arm compiled rather
than just the feature list. **That is `wcc -pl`'s rule turned on the host:
a symbol in `SHOW FEATURES` is a claim about one file; the binary is the
evidence.** Report the missing Darwin arm upstream — item 8.

---

## §16ay: upstream 11.0.508 is merged, and the port is unmoved by it

**17 August 2026, no Victor in reach.** PR #3 (77 upstream commits) merged;
five MAME legs at 9600 regression it — `HW_TEST_16ay.md`, PORTING.md §16ay,
counters in `v9k/legs/STEPU*.OUT`. **All five pass, `rxlost = 0 rxfull = 0`
throughout, every transfer byte-exact. No upstream edit — still twenty**,
and all twenty were verified present by diffing HEAD against the merge's
upstream parent (`616e369^2`) before any leg ran, which is exact where a
`VICTOR9K` grep is not. DGROUP 48,896 (74%), image 230,756, needs 242,852
(237K), **smallest Victor 384K, unchanged**, warnings 18, `ckvictor.c` 0.
Proofs (vcrc16, vburst, vttinl, vwindow) all pass.

**Coverage:** UA/UE 32 KB receive (edits 11, 17, 18), UB a 32,768-byte send
**by name** (edit 16's exact range — second confirmation ever, first under
MAME, 663 cps and zero resends), UC the server sweep (edit 19's dates and
edit 20's `Free space: 536K`, plus a 162-file root listing), UD the parser
build running `SPDTEST.KSC` by absolute path (edits 12, 13, 14, 15).

**Two things for the next session.**

1. **The `KEEP_ICP` build changed machine class**: 429,890 (419K, 512K
   Victor) → **453,602 (442K, 640K Victor)**, DGROUP 59,632 of 65,536
   (90%), 5,904 bytes left. Nothing ships from it, but no previous merge
   has moved a class, and the next one has less room to do it in.
2. **The ~27 s stall between the F packet and its ACK is unexplained and
   is not the merge's.** Three timeouts at 8, 16 and 24 s on every 9600
   receive, before a data phase that then runs clean at ~609 cps; §16aj FA
   and §16ar WD have it from before the merge. Leg UE was spent refuting
   the obvious explanation (it is not a start-order race — starting the
   host 40 s later reproduced UA to 56 ms). The Victor is inside
   `rcvfil()`. **It is the cheapest open question in the tree** and it
   makes every whole-run cps figure at 9600 under MAME ~35% low.

---

## §16ax: the whole server capability set, on the wire

**16–17 August 2026, no Victor in reach.** Six MAME legs at 9600 (SA, SB,
SE, SC, SF), **upstream edits 19 and 20 — the count is now twenty**, both
agreed before being written. DGROUP **48,896 (74%)**, image **230,690**,
needs **242,786 (237K)** — the requirement moved for the first time since
§16aq — **smallest Victor 384K, unchanged**, warnings 18, `ckvictor.c` 0.
md5 `0bdecef1…`.

**§16i's oldest open item is closed.** `BYE` works — ACK, `doclean()`,
`zkself()`, clean exit, `rxlost=0 rxfull=0 rxpeak=22` — so FINISH is no
longer the only way the far end can stop a Victor server. PWD, CD, MKDIR,
RMDIR, DIRECTORY, TYPE, COPY, RENAME, DELETE, RETRIEVE, SET, MESSAGE, HELP,
SPACE and EXIT all work; HOST, QUERY, ASSIGN, PRINT, LOGIN and WHO refuse
cleanly by name; **`--safe-server` is on the wire for the first time** —
six commands refused, `GET` still byte-exact.

**Three defects, all fixed and all verified by leg SF.**

1. **SPACE and WHO were advertised and impossible.** The server's own
   `REMOTE HELP` said `Enabled` while both answered `Can't check space` /
   `Can't do who command`; both go through `syscmd()`, whose body `NOPUSH`
   deletes. **WHO is zeroed. SPACE got an answer** — upstream edit 20, a
   `VICTOR9K` arm in `ckcpro.w` + `ckcfns.c` calling `v9k_dskspace()`
   (INT 21h `AH=36h`). Leg SF says `Free space: 416K`; `vtg_image_util
   info` says `416.0 KB`.
2. **`REMOTE RMDIR` could not remove a directory.** `ckmkdir()` appends
   `/` for both directions on the `UNIXOROSK` arm; `AH=3Ah` refuses it.
   `ckvictor.h` macro + nine-line `v9k_rmdir()`, **no upstream edit** —
   upstream's OS/2 arm appends the slash only for `mkdir`, which is the
   tell.
3. **Every date the server reported was 1970.** `zfcdat()`'s
   `unsigned int mtime` truncates a `time_t` — upstream edit 19, guarded.
   It hit the listing *and* the file date attribute: two `GET`s of one
   file, one binary apart, landed dated `Jan 1 1970` and `Aug 16 22:02`.

**Two harness lessons, and the second one is the expensive one.** Leg SA's
`.OUT` came back 0 bytes because its last command, `REMOTE EXIT`, failed on
the host and the server never exited — **ask what a leg's terminating
command does to the channel the leg reports through**. And five commands
never reached the wire at all because **C-Kermit 9.0.302's `remcfm()` is
eight years behind this tree** (`ckuus7.c:7455`, fixed 2014-11-03): PWD,
HELP, EXIT, COPY and RENAME all answer `?Not confirmed` on an empty
argument. Use `remote pwd > file`. §16am's rule from a third direction.
**Make `REMOTE HELP` the first command of every future server leg** — one
round trip, and it prints the entire `en_*` configuration as the server
understands it.

**Still untested after all six legs:** `REMOTE STATUS` (the 9.0.302 client
has no such command; `<generic>Q` and `sndstatus()` are compiled in and
have never been asked), and `en_ena`/`en_ret`, which **have no reader in
this build** — `RETRIEVE` is gated by `en_del`, and `ENABLE` lives in the
parser `NOICP` removes.

**On the image now** (partition 0 is down to **416 KB free, 4.2%** — the
next session should clear the old `CK*.EXE` legs or use `D:`):
`CKSRV2.EXE` 230,690 md5 `0bdecef1…` is the current shipping build;
`CKSRV.EXE` 230,274 md5 `4a98698c…` is the one-change build legs SE and SC
ran; `CKRDR2.EXE` 230,274 md5 `5f2a1580…` is §16aw's, which legs SA and SB
ran. `STEPSA/SB/SE/SF.BAT` and `SRVA.TXT` are staged; host side
`s16axS*.ksc` in the tree.

---

## §16av: six travel-desk items, no hardware, and two of them were worse
## than the notes said

**15 August 2026, no Victor in reach.** Ten MAME legs at 9600 (NA, NB, NC,
ND, NF, NR, NS, NT, NU, NX), static analysis, and one host tool. **No
upstream edit — still eighteen.** DGROUP 48,816 (74%), image **230,224**,
**needs 242,288 (236K)**, **smallest Victor 384K, unchanged**, warnings 18,
`ckvictor.c` 0. md5 `5b7eb873…`.

**The image grew 3,058 bytes and the machine only sees 1,074.** The rest
is relocation table and paragraph padding. That gap is the reason hard
rule 4 says to quote `mzsize.py` and not `ls -l`, and this is the widest
it has ever been in one change.

**1. `msleep()` sleeps now, and it is measured.** `NAP` in `ckvictor.h`
puts `msleep()` on its own `nap()` arm (`ckutio.c:12065`) and `ckvictor.c`
§1d supplies a calibrated busy loop — INT 21h's clock advances in 500 ms
steps, so anything shorter has to be counted, not timed. **`v9k: nap
per=409 n=1 req=500 ms tot=50 cs` on five legs**, `per` identical on all
five. The defect read **175 µs** on a scope (§16an); it now reads one
clock quantum, which is what a true 500 ms sleep reads. **Every run
exercises it** — `exithangup` is 1, so `ttclos()` → `tthang()` →
`msleep(500)` — so the exit path is ~1.5 s longer and DTR/RTS really drop.
`tcsendbreak()` is fixed by the same change and is still unexercised.

**2. FILE COLLISION defaults to REPLACE, and the old story was wrong.**
The port has never run BACKUP: `initproto()` copies `ptab[PROTO_K].fnca`
(statically **`XYFX_D`**, `ckcmai.c:727`) over `ckcmai.c:1326`'s `XYFX_B`
before anything reads it, so `znewn()` has never been called and the
shipped behaviour was a **flat refusal**. **The first fix walked into
§16ai's trap and `v9k: coll=` caught it** — leg NB read `coll=4` after an
initializer that wrote 1. Fixed by writing `ptab`, verified by legs NC/ND:
two different 4 KB fixtures, one filename, nothing deleted between them,
**0 timeouts, 0 retransmissions, 641 cps, and the file off the image has
the SECOND fixture's md5.** `-dV9K_COLLISION=XYFX_D` restores the refusal.
**But `--safe-server` overrides it to RENAME** (`ckcpro.c:502`, because
`en_del` is off) **and RENAME cannot work on FAT either.** Two
report-upstream items, §16av part 2.

**3. Out of disk was an INFINITE LOOP, not a missing timeout.**
`zoutdump()` (`ckufio.c:2172`) tests `write() > -1` and DOS returns **0
with CF clear** on a full volume — so it subtracts nothing, advances
nothing, and goes round for ever. No `alarm()` can reach a receiver that
never asks to read. One compare in `v9k_write()` turns "wrote nothing, no
error" into `ENOSPC`. **Leg NF: an image filled to 8.0 KB free, 32 KB
sent, host reports `FAILURE / Error writing data` in 58 s** where the
documented behaviour is a hang that outlives the host. `-dV9K_NOSPC_OFF`
is the control and **has not been run**. Leg NF's own `.OUT` is 0 bytes —
the redirect was on the disk under test; use `> D:\` next time.

**4. Ctrl-C was two keystrokes from leaving IRQ1 hooked.** Watcom's
`raise()` demotes SIGINT to `SIG_DFL` and hands INT 23h back to DOS
*before* calling the handler (`bld/clib/process/c/signl.c`), so a handler
fires once; and upstream's `cctrap` sets `cc_int`, **which is read nowhere
in the tree**. So the first ^C did nothing observable and spent the single
shot, and the second killed the program with the chip hooked. Fixed with a
self-re-arming handler installed from `v9k_ser_install()`. **`cc=0` on
every leg — the mechanism is established from both runtimes' sources and
NOTHING HAS PRESSED CTRL-C ON A VICTOR.** That is a bench item.

**5. The "one binary, two DOSes" claim was false, in two places.** IRQ1 is
INT 41h under MS-DOS 3.1 and **INT 09h under FreeDOS for Victor**
(`myfreedos/kernel/victor_pic.asm`, ICW2 0x40 vs 0x08). ICW2 is
write-only, so the question goes to INT 21h `AH=30h`, whose BH is **0xFD**
for FreeDOS. **`v9k: dos oem=ff ver=310 irq1=41` on every leg** — the
MS-DOS branch, unchanged. And the console: §16ao's VT52 is right for
MS-DOS 3.1 and FreeDOS's `victor_ansi.asm:154` passes anything that is not
`ESC [` **straight through to the screen**, so §1g now has an ANSI arm
chosen by the same probe. **Neither FreeDOS branch has ever executed.**

**6. `REMOTE DIRECTORY` is two defects and one of them is fixed.**
`MAXWLD` 64 and `SSPACE` 2048 both carried a comment saying the limit
could not be reached in practice; **this project's own image has 156 files
in its root** and an ordinary listing reaches both (leg NR: `?Too many
files (64 max)` and `E No files match`). Raised to **256 / 4096** — heap,
so the load requirement does not move, **and §16aw has now confirmed that
half at full scale** — 158 entries expanded and listed, which leg NT never
reached. **The second half of this item is RETRACTED BY §16aw: there is no
second defect.** It said leg NT "reproduced §16i's original defect" — the
listing streaming and then the Victor resending packet 14 every ~10 s while
the host ACKed each one, never answering the FINISH — and that leg NU
bounded it at three entries. **All of that was `-d`.** `nxtdir()` debugs
four times per output character, so the log costs ~100 ms a character and
leg NT was producing one every 115 ms; leg RA runs the same command on the
same root with the log shut and finishes in **31.077 s, 0 timeouts, 0
retransmissions**. The three resends were three queued NAKs answered
correctly. The 0-byte `.OUT` and `DEBUG.LOG` were real and are still the
reason nobody could see this from the Victor's side — but what they were
hiding was a slow run, not a stuck one.

**7. `v9k/tools/wirenoise.py`** replaces `socat` in the MAME harness and
corrupts the wire on purpose, so §16aq's untested "both arms recover
identically" claim can finally be run. Corruption is keyed on **byte
offset, not a random sequence**, so two arms meet the same noise even
after they diverge, and a leg is reproducible from its seed. Its first
mixer had a **visible period of 100** and was caught by looking at the
offsets; splitmix64 replaced it. **Self-tested on the host; no leg run.**

**What generalises, from §16av's last section:** a counter written to catch
a known trap caught that exact trap (`coll=`); two `ckvictor.h` comments
asserted a limit could not be reached and an ordinary listing reached both;
a leg that fills the disk cannot report through a file on that disk and a
leg that never exits cannot report through a buffered log — **ask what the
failure under test does to the channel the leg reports through**; and
**the other end of `wcc -pl` is somebody else's source tree** — two of
these six were settled by reading Open Watcom's and FreeDOS's own sources,
neither of which this project had ever opened.

**Item 12 — sliding windows — is BUILT, MEASURED THIRTEEN TIMES ON THE
MACHINE, AND CLOSED. Nothing ships. §16au.** `--window=N` is a run-time
switch on the shipping binary and `V9K_RXBUFSIZ` is now a build lever, both
for **no upstream edit — still eighteen**, smallest Victor still 384K. A
window of 2 negotiates end to end, transfers byte-exact, and **once the
ring is sized to hold W × (packet wire length) it costs 1 ms.** 25.789 s at
window 1 against 25.788 / 25.804 at window 2. **`DFWSIZ` 1, `DRPSIZ` 4000,
`V9K_RXBUFSIZ` 4096 — every default unchanged.**

**THE MODEL BEHIND IT, IN THIS FILE SINCE §16v, IS RETRACTED.** "Line and
foreground are strictly serialized, so overlapping them takes 25.66 s
toward ~16 s" — **they were already overlapped.** `ttinl()` processes bytes
as they arrive, so the 9.77 s of "line time" is not idle waiting for the
wire; it is the CPU busy in the ISR and the per-byte loop. **That ~16 s
ceiling does not exist.**

> **On a single-CPU machine with no DMA the "I/O" IS CPU work, in an ISR.
> Overlapping I/O with compute cannot create capacity, only relabel which
> bucket the cycles fall in. The only lever is doing less work per byte.**

**Test any future throughput idea against that sentence before building
it** — it is why edits 17 and 18 worked and this did not. **And item 9 has
its number at last: ~65 ms per packet.** Read item 12, then §16au.

**§16aq is upstream edit 18 and it is the largest single gain this port has
measured: 17.6% faster and 6.4× less ring pressure.** `ttinl()`'s per-byte
loop now has a bulk arm that finds the terminator in the already-buffered run
with `memchr()` and copies it with `memcpy()` — `repne scasb` and `rep movsw`
**do not refetch**, which is what §16w says bounds this machine. Six clean
legs, three per arm: **25.660 s against 31.140 s, 1,277 cps against 1,052**,
with within-arm spreads of **16 ms and 9 ms**, so the effect is 343× the
floor and the arms never come within 5.469 s of touching. Non-line cost
15.895 s against 21.375 — **25.6% of the foreground gone**. Image 226,330,
needs 240,378 (234K), **smallest Victor still 384K**.

**The design rests on a fact `wcc -pl` found and the source hides.**
`ckvictor.h:1100` defines `NOPARSEN` with the comment "No network directory
parse"; `ckcdeb.h:3971` uses it to suppress `PARSENSE`, and `ckcdeb.h:3966`
says what that costs — **length-driven packet reading**. So this build has
never compiled the `ttinl()` that `ckutio.c` reads like it has: a packet ends
at `eol` and nowhere else. That is why `memchr()` is *exactly* equivalent
rather than approximately, on corrupted input as well as clean. **Leave
`NOPARSEN` alone** — turning `PARSENSE` on adds per-byte header bookkeeping
and the lookahead/pushback, which moves foreground cost the wrong way.

**Two things from §16aq generalise beyond the edit.** `--nobulk` makes the
control and the treatment **the same binary**, so §16w's code-size
sensitivity has nothing to act on — reach for that shape whenever a feature
can be switched at run time. And `v9k: bulk sel= n=` exists because **an
equivalence test cannot see a switch that silently failed**: a correct arm
returns the byte loop's answer either way, and a mutation deleting the switch
escaped every case in `v9k/proofs/vttinl.c` until the counter existed. Read
the counter before the clock.

**The ring is no longer under any pressure and that is what item 12 was
waiting for.** `rxpeak` is **459 of 4,096** on a clean receive, against
§16af's 2,581. Windows were gated on ring margin; there is now ~3,600 bytes
of it. Line and foreground are still strictly serialized at `DFWSIZ = 1`
(9.77 s + 15.90 s), so **overlapping them is worth more than edit 18 was.**

**§16aq's Part 3 was attempted and the stimulus did not fire.** Legs KN/KP
ran bulk against `--nobulk` over a 10-foot cable wrapped around mains wiring
and both came back at the clean 37,557 wire bytes with zero crunched packets
and `rxlost = 0`. **That is an instrument failure, not a null result** — the
claim that both arms recover from corruption identically is still untested.
Magnetic coupling goes with *current*, not voltage; a switching load beside
the cable is a stimulus where proximity to quiet wiring is not. §16am's rule,
third outing: **before running an experiment that depends on something
happening, measure that it can happen.**

**§16ao: the port had NO file-transfer display at all, and now it has the
fullscreen one — validated on real hardware at 38400, both directions.**
`ckvictor.h` defined `NOCURSES`; `ckcdeb.h:6098` turns that into
`NODISPLAY`; `ckcker.h:730` then expands `xxscreen()` and `ckscreen()` to
**nothing**. Every transfer this project has ever run showed a blank screen
and nobody noticed, because **every instrumented leg redirects stdout**,
which sets `backgrd` and would have suppressed the display anyway. Fixed
with `CK_CURSES` + `CK_CURPOS` in `ckvictor.h`, a new **`victorow/curses.h`**,
and **`ckvictor.c` §1g** — the Victor console in **VT52/Z19** (`ESC Y
(row+0x20)(col+0x20)`, `ESC E`, `ESC K`), which is INT 21h only, so hard
rule 6 holds. **No upstream edit — still seventeen.** Image 206,758 →
**225,638**, needs **239,702 (234K)**, **smallest Victor still 384K**.

**Four things from it that generalise:**

1. **Ask the preprocessor before you ask the machine.** Four runtime gates
   (`fdispla`, `local`, `backgrd`, `displa`) were traced and *all four
   passed* across a bench sitting and three MAME legs, because there were no
   call sites for them to gate. `wcc -pl` settled it in one second. §16aj's
   rule, third time: **a line of upstream source is not evidence that the
   build compiles it.**
2. **A diagnostic must not change the thing it measures.** The first
   `backgrd` reading was taken as `CKICPD -d -h > output.log`, and the
   redirect set the exact variable under test. `-d` writes its own log; the
   redirect was never needed.
3. **A display leg and a throughput leg cannot be the same leg.** The
   `.OUT` redirect sets `backgrd = 1` and suppresses the display. Photograph
   the exit screen or run one of each. **`v9k: wcon n=` tells you which case
   you are in**: 0 = no display, ~485 = fullscreen on a 32 KB receive.
4. **"Everything goes through one path" is a claim to enumerate.** The
   first build painted every field correctly and concatenated onto two
   lines, because `printw` is buffered `printf` while `move()` is unbuffered
   `conol()`. `fflush()` before each escape sequence, and in `refresh()`.

**§16ap measured what it costs, and the answer is a constant: ~4-5 s per
32 KB transfer at ANY line rate**, because it is console-write time and
console writes do not care about the wire. Eight legs, all byte-exact,
`rxlost = 0 rxfull = 0` throughout. **Receive at 38400: 4.188 s against a
control spread of 0.310 s** (13.0%); send 5.035 s (22.6%, on a wire-
identical pair); receive at 9600 4.395 s (7.7%). **The percentages differ
only because the denominator does.** MAME's 4.5 s was right and its 3.8%
was not — *quote the seconds, the percentage is a property of the
denominator*. **It does not touch the ring**: `rxpeak` 2,975 with the
display against 3,032 without, on legs with the same retransmission count.

**Two things came out of §16ap that outlive it.** The control was **the
same binary** — redirecting stdout turns the display off at runtime, so
§16w's code-size sensitivity had nothing to act on for the first time in
this project's history; reach for that shape whenever a feature can be
disabled at runtime. And **`wcon tot=` is unbiased but very noisy**: two
protocol-identical legs 108 ms apart read 350 and 600 cs, because each
console write is far shorter than the 0.5 s tick and `tot` is a sum of
0-or-500 ms samples. **`n=` is exact; `tot=` is ±1.5 s on one leg** — average
it over four or do not quote it, and the same applies to `wfile tot=` and
`txgap tot=`.

**`--nodisplay` is BUILT** — the decision rule fired and the switch is
`ckvictor.c`'s fourth command-tail option after `--safe-server` and the
three flow ones. It sets `fdispla = XYFD_N`, which the `xxscreen()` macro
tests before calling anything, so the display costs one compare per packet
when off. **No upstream edit**, +184 bytes (**225,822**), DGROUP unchanged,
smallest Victor still 384K. Verified under MAME at 9600 with no redirect:
byte-exact, `rxlost = 0 rxfull = 0`, **`wcon n = 1` against leg HG's 514**,
and the unknown-option control (`--nodisplaz` → `Extended options not
configured`) was run per §16i's rule. **Then verified on the machine —
§16ap leg HJ**, 38400 receive, byte-exact, `wcon n = 1` with no redirect,
and it makes **four legs at 38400 receive carrying an identical 37,557 wire
bytes in 18 packets with zero retransmissions**: HJ 30.960 s and HA 31.568
against HB 35.965 and HD 35.857. **The switch and the redirect give the
same control to 0.608 s**, so the switch costs nothing of its own, and
`rxpeak` across the four is 2,974 / 2,975 / 2,975 / 3,032 — **HA is the
outlier and the display is not.**

**Two traps this sequence walked into, both now rules.** `CKERMITW.EXE` was
left as the stale 206,758-byte pre-display build while the work shipped
under the staging name `CKDISP.EXE`, so `CKERMITW --nodisplay` answered
`Extended options not configured` — **the same string the unknown-option
control produces**, which reads exactly like a broken switch. The name now
means what `CLAUDE.md` says it means: **225,822, md5 `3759f47f…`, round-trip
verified off the image, and `CKDISP.EXE` is deleted.** And **a re-run gets a
new leg letter**: HJ re-used `s16aoHB.ksc`, so it overwrote HB's `.host` and
truncated its `.pkt`, both `.gitignore`d — leg HB's artefacts are gone and
its figures survive only in §16ap. §6's "unique log names" was written for
MAME; it is the bench's rule too. **`> NUL` still works too**, but the
switch keeps stdout on the console — which means **a display leg and an
instrumented leg can be the same leg again**, and §16ao's "they cannot" is
now only true of the redirect. **Do not reach for `-dNOCURSES`**: it deletes
the CRT display too and moves code size by 18,880 bytes. And **FreeDOS-for-Victor will paint noise**:
`kernel/victor_ansi.asm:141` parses only `ESC [`. That is the port's first
behavioural difference between the two DOSes; see item 14.

**`HW_TEST_16ai.md` RAN, 9 August 2026 — all seven legs, every transferred
file byte-exact, `rxlost = 0 rxfull = 0` throughout. PORTING.md §16ai is the
write-up.** In one sitting:

- **The prefixing fix is verified and it is exactly what was predicted.**
  Leg CC came back `PX_CAU exactly (32 values)`, **4,512 prefixes, 37,557
  wire bytes, +14.6%**; the control CD came back `PX_ALL exactly (66)`,
  8,869, 41,945, +28.0%. **4,388 wire bytes saved, −10.5%.**
  **CD reproduced §16ah leg BS on every measure** — prefixes, wire bytes,
  packet count, `rxbytes = 216` — with host clocks **29 ms apart** on a bench
  whose spread is 1.3 s. That is the best null leg this project has produced.
- **1,475 cps is the fastest figure the port has ever produced** (CC).
  But CC and CD are 1.397 s apart against a ~1.3 s floor, so **quote the
  wire-byte count as the result and the cps as an illustration.**
- **Server mode works on real hardware, a first.** Leg CS: SEND to the
  server 1,058 cps, GET from the server 1,431, then FINISH — both `SUCCESS`,
  both byte-exact, no E packet. `HW_TESTING.md` leg 0.7 is closed and item 13
  below with it.
- **The parser build transfers, a first.** Leg CH: 32,768 bytes at 38400,
  byte-exact, `rxpeak = 2,852 of 4,096`, 1,213 cps — inside the shipping
  build's band, so the wire protocol did not move. Item 7 is closed.

**The only two failures in the sitting were the run sheet's**, and both are
fixed. See "The harness had two defects" below — they are the kind that make
a working port look broken, so they are worth reading before the next
sitting.

---

## What changed at the desk, 9 August, after §16ah

**A shipping-behaviour defect was found and fixed, and item 5a is
superseded.** `ckvictor.h` has selected `PX_CAU` prefixing since §16ae and
**every leg this project has ever run sent `PX_ALL`.** `main()` reaches
`initproto(PROTO_K,...)` at `ckcmai.c:3295` before `setprefix(prefixing)` at
3413, and `initproto` copies `ptab[protocol].prefix` — statically `PX_ALL`,
and `PX_ALL` is 0 so the `> -1` test passes — over whatever the XI
initializer put in the variable, 118 lines before anything reads it.
Upstream knows this about its own ordering: `ckcmai.c:3319` says
`compat_9()`/`compat_10()` run *"after initproto calls so initial file
transfer settings are not overwritten"*. **An XI record runs before `main()`,
which is the one position from which that guarantee does not hold.** Fixed
by writing `ptab[PROTO_K].prefix`, which is what `initproto` copies *from*.
No upstream edit — still seventeen. **Unverified on the wire; that is legs
CC/CD.**

**How it was found generalises, and it is the reason `pktstat.py` was
rewritten first.** Not by reading the source — the source had been read
twice and produced the comment the fix replaces — but by decoding the prefix
characters out of `s16ahBS.pkt`. **A run's `ctlp[]` table is recoverable from
the wire**, because every value the sender prefixed appears after a QCTL.
Leg BS prefixed exactly the 66 values `setprefix()` sets for `PX_ALL`; the
host, over the identical fixture in the same session, prefixed exactly the 32
it sets for `PX_CAU`. **A setting that is applied and then quietly
overwritten looks exactly like a setting that was never right; only the wire
tells them apart.**

**`pktstat.py` reads send legs now, and counts wire bytes.** It measured only
the lines the log-writer *sent*, so on a send leg it reported the host's ACK
stream — "longest 49, retransmissions 0" for a log whose longest packet is
3,716 and which holds four Victor resends. Both halves fixed. A remote
retransmission has no marker of its own; it is the same sequence number
arriving twice running. **`--rxbytes` reconciles the log against the Victor's
ISR counter**, which counts the same bytes by an independent route:
`host wire bytes − rxbytes = rxfull + startup offset`. On §16af leg AJ that
residual is **exactly the 741 `rxfull` that leg published**; on a clean leg it
is −11, or +28 where a startup timeout means the Victor missed the first S
packet.

**Two of §16ah's published figures are withdrawn.** Its send/receive table
gives 40,726 and 35,950 wire bytes, +24.3% and +9.7%. Counted from the logs
— and cross-checked against `rxbytes` to the byte on leg BC — they are
**41,945 (+28.0%)** and **37,585 (+14.7%)**. The 14.7% is what §1 item 9
already quotes for this fixture, so §16ah's table was the outlier. **The
conclusion survives and is now correctly attributed**: it is `PX_ALL`
measured against `PX_CAU`, not two ends disagreeing about one policy.

**Item 7.0 is done.** `CKICP.EXE` and `CKICPD.EXE` are rebuilt from HEAD,
re-measured and staged: **435,154 / needs 429,890 (419K) / smallest Victor
512K with 1,678 bytes spare**, and **546,422 / needs 533,110 (520K) /
smallest Victor 640K**. The stale 8 August copies are gone. `CKPXALL.EXE` is
new — the same tree and the same 205,228 bytes as `CKERMITW.EXE`, differing
only in one immediate constant, which makes it a control with **no code-size
difference at all** for §16w to bite on.

---

**Flow control is built, run on the machine, and shipped OFF — PORTING.md
§16aj (build), §16ak (seven bench legs), §16al (four more).** RTS/CTS and
XON/XOFF, both directions, both interrupt handlers, `tcflow()` implemented,
`--rtscts` / `--xonxoff` / `--noflow`, **no upstream edit**. Eleven bench
legs, every transferred file byte-exact, `rxfull = 0` throughout.

**Two results decide it, and they point opposite ways:**

- **It is free.** §1f costs **≤ 0.11 s on a 32 KB receive** — leg GP, the
  pre-§1f binary, has a non-line cost of 21.43 s against the shipping
  build's 21.54 (§16al) — and turning RTS/CTS on at the shipping marks was
  **6 ms** from its control (§16ak leg DE). The CTS gate on the
  transmitter's per-byte path ran at **1,475 cps**, the port's fastest
  figure (§16ak leg DS).
- **The output half has never been tested.** §16al leg GB dropped RTS
  **eleven** times on a clean byte-exact leg and `rxpeak` came back **2,974
  against its control's 2,978** — and **§16am retracts it**: the bench
  Mac's C-Kermit has no `POSIX_CRTSCTS`, so its `tthflow()` is empty and
  `set flow rts/cts` never configured the port. The far end was never able
  to pause. `HW_TEST_16am.md` is the leg that answers it without Kermit.

So `V9K_FLOW` stays `FLO_NONE` for a *measured* reason. §1 item 11 has the
three remaining candidates for the RTS fault and the one cheap leg left
(`--xonxoff` at 1024/896 against a `--noflow` control). Shipping build:
DGROUP **48,336 (73%)**, image **206,758**, **needs 220,950 (215K)**,
smallest Victor **384K, unchanged**, md5 `c5652a5b…`.

**§16ak's "+11% for §1f" is WITHDRAWN.** The same `CKPRE` binary had a
non-line cost of 18.29 s in §16ah and 21.43 s in §16al, wire held constant
— **the bench's run-to-run spread is the host, not the Victor**, which is
also the standing answer to §1 item 5b.

**Two upstream defects came out of it and neither is fixed** (§1 item 8):
`ttpkt()`'s `TESTING234` block clears `IXON|IXOFF` four lines before the
`tcsetattr()` that applies them, and the only call to `tcflow(TCOON)` in
`ckutio.c` sits inside a `debug()` argument that `NODEBUG` deletes. **Do
not quote `ckutio.c:6252`/`:6617` as "the plumbing is already there"** —
that claim, which lived in this file, was wrong in both halves.

**Three harness failures cost three sittings in this sequence and each is
now a rule rather than an anecdote:** a re-run into a target name that
already existed (`SET FILE COLLISION BACKUP` cannot work on FAT — put
`IF EXIST <target> DEL <target>` in every receive `.BAT`); a run sheet that
named a `-d` flag without staging the binary that carried it; and **a full
image**, which makes a working port look thoroughly broken — eleven packets,
then a hang, on a binary that had transferred cleanly twice before.
**`vtg_image_util info <img>` goes in every run sheet's §0**, and partition
1 (`D:`) is 9.7 MB, 100% free, and has never been used.

What is open is *verification* rather than repair, and the ordering in §1
reflects that.

**§16ah ran `HW_TEST_16ag.md`'s seven legs and §1 items 1, 2 and 4 are
closed.** All seven byte-exact, `rxlost = 0 rxfull = 0`, host clock captured
on every one. What changed:

- **Upstream edit 16 is verified** (leg BS) — the port's last shipped edit
  with only a `wdis` reading behind it.
- **The `errno` change is removed**, under the rule written before the legs
  ran. It measured slower on both instruments.
- **§16af's CRC-16 cost is superseded** — 69–103 µs per wire byte, not 26.
- **The bench does not repeat to better than ~1.3 s**, which is the fact that
  governs every future A/B on it.

**Read `PORTING.md` §16ah first** — seven bench legs, a closed edit, a
removed change, and a retraction of §16af's headline number — then §16ag for
the two free items of which only one was free, then §16af — the seventeenth upstream edit, the
bench legs that measured it, and three prediction failures that generalise
— then §11a0 for the clock tree and why 38400 is a hardware ceiling, then
§16ae for the block-check analysis §16af rests on. §16t is still the best
thing in the file for its four wrong turns.

**One thing to understand before reading any number below.** The Victor's
clock advances in 50 cs steps, so a one-second difference between two legs
is *one quantum*. §16ah captured the host's millisecond clock on all seven
legs and **the quantum turned out not to be the binding limit — the bench's
own run-to-run spread is.** Two legs of one binary, both clean, eleven wire
bytes apart, came back **1.277 s apart**, where §16ag's MAME arms held to
1 ms. So: **do not make a bench claim about an effect smaller than ~1.3 s
on two legs per arm**, and expect roughly a third of legs to go off-shape
and be unusable for an A/B. That is what retired §16af's "one clock
quantum" (see §16ah), and it governs everything below.

**§16ak is a second data point and it points the other way: 398 ms.** Three
protocol-identical clean receive legs came in at 31.137, 31.143 and 31.535 s
on the same 37,557 wire bytes, and the closest two are **6 ms** apart; the
two send legs are **3 ms** apart. So ~1.3 s is a **bound and not a floor**,
whatever causes it is intermittent, and item 5b is still open with one more
sitting to compare. **Do not relax the rule on one sitting** — but do check
the actual spread of your own null pair before deciding an effect is
invisible.

**And §16aj shows MAME is not automatically the quiet instrument either.**
Its two groups of legs, same fixture and same rate, drifted **12–15 s
apart** because the host machine got busier — the host's own timeout count
went 3 → 5 and C-Kermit's slow start then chose a different packet shape,
24 packets and a longest of 3,991 early against 38 and 3,387 late. §16ag's
1 ms was a property of that sitting, not of the emulator. **Run the control
adjacent to the treatment and compare nothing across a gap.**

---

## 0. Where the port is

**File transfer works, both directions, as client and as server, at 9600,
19200 and 38400, on real hardware, byte-exact.** At 38400 with CRC-16
intact it **receives at ~1,167 cps and sends at 1,386** (§16ah legs BC and
BS) — the send figure is the fastest this port has produced, and sending
beats receiving by 19% *while carrying 13% more wire traffic*, which is the
receive foreground being the bottleneck seen from the other side. **Read
those two against §1 item 5b before differencing them with anything: this
bench does not repeat to better than ~1.3 s.** §16af leg AG, for the
counter shape:

```
v9k: isr=asm
v9k: rxlost=0 rxfull=0 rxpeak=2581 of 4096
v9k: peaktag=12 fd=6 stall256=27
v9k: rxbytes=37568 peakat=15673 stallat=840
v9k: elapsed=2800 cs wire=1341 B/s
v9k: mdm cts=1 dsr=1 (dcd=1 rts=1 dtr=1, see comment)
```

18 packets, longest 3,991, zero NAKs, zero retransmissions, zero timeouts.
cps here is 32,768 ÷ the Victor's `elapsed`, which is the wider interval
(§16u) and therefore conservative. **Leg AG's own host figure was never
captured** and the estimate of ~1,245 that used to sit here should not be
used: §16ah measured the same binary and block check properly (legs BC/BD,
28.057 and 29.334 s) and found the run-to-run spread larger than the
estimate's precision.

**§16af closed the ring defect and dissolved §16ae's trade-off.** Upstream
edit 17 rewrites `chk3()` for `VICTOR9K` — same CRC-16, same polynomial,
same init, no final XOR — in `unsigned int` through one 256-entry table
instead of in `long` through two `long[16]`. On an 8088 built with `-0` the
old form put **two software shift loops** on the per-byte path; 603 cycles
became 81. Measured against a same-session baseline control that reproduced
§16ae leg PC **to the byte**:

| | AJ (baseline × 3) | **AG (edit 17 × 3)** | AH (edit 17 × 1) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `rxfull` | **741** | **0** | 0 |
| `rxpeak` | 4,095 *pinned* | **2,581** | 2,585 |
| `rxbytes` | 44,720 | **37,568** | 37,534 |
| packets / resends | 26 / 3 | **18 / 0** | 18 / 0 |
| `elapsed=` | 3,800 cs | **2,800 cs** | 2,700 cs |

**CRC-16 now costs one clock quantum over a 6-bit checksum** (28.00 vs
27.00 s) where it cost 11.5 s, so there is no speed argument left for
shipping weaker error detection. All four legs (three bench, one MAME)
byte-exact.

**What that leaves.** `rxpeak` at 2,581 of 4,096 means **the ring is no
longer the binding constraint** and §16k's sizing argument no longer needs
redoing. `peaktag = 12` still names foreground packet decoding. Line time
is 9.77 s of AG's 28.00, so the foreground is ~485 µs per wire byte and the
**no-line ceiling is ~1,797 cps** (AH's is ~1,900). §16v's ~1,353 is
superseded.

Also standing from §16v: **`cts = 1` on the real cable**, so RTS/CTS is
available *inbound* and flow control does not have to be XON/XOFF. §16aj
built both and left the default off; the outbound half — our RTS at the
host's CTS — is still unmeasured and is what item 11 now turns on.

**Flow control exists and is switched off** (§16aj, `ckvictor.c` §1f) —
RTS/CTS and XON/XOFF, both directions, in both handlers, `tcflow()`
implemented, four instructions per byte in the ISR. §1 item 11 is the one
leg that decides whether the default changes.

**Seventeen** upstream edits, fourteen of them guarded no-ops elsewhere.
**14, 15 and 16 are the exceptions and are flagged as such** — 14 moves a
mis-nested `#endif` (which cannot be placed conditionally), 15 and 16 each
fix a 16-bit truncation and are provable no-ops wherever `int` is 32 bits.
Edit 17 is guarded even though it did not have to be, because it is an
optimisation for one CPU and not a defect fix.
DGROUP **48,336 of 65,536 (73%)**, image **206,758**, **needs 220,950
(215K) at load — smallest Victor 384K** (§16aj; it was 48,304 / 205,212 /
219,452 through §16ai, and the smallest machine did not move).

**§16y built the interactive command parser.** `XFLAGS=-dKEEP_ICP
ZT=-zt2048` links, loads on the Victor and prints a parser's help text —
**429,890 (419K)** at load — **smallest Victor 512K** — against the shipping
build's 219,452 (384K). **It is a feature this port intends to ship, not an
instrument**; `NOICP` is a default chosen because 384K reaches three times
as many machines, not a verdict that the parser cannot be had. Three fixes,
no upstream edit: `isfloat()` (§2b), `__near` on the receive ring, and the
threshold. **§16z, §16aa and §16ab regression-tested it on the machine.**
Four defects, all latent for the port's whole life and none reachable
without the parser, all fixed in `ckvictor.c` for no upstream edit:

- one cached `struct termios` for the console and the line, so `SET SPEED`
  did not stick (§16z);
- `ttyname()` said every descriptor was `CON:`, so `SET LINE` left the
  program in remote mode (§16aa) — **fixed and confirmed on hardware**,
  `SET LINE local=1`, and `SET SPEED 19200` now reads back;
- no `ICRNL` on console input (§16aa) — fixed and confirmed, `gtword` is
  handed 10 — but **the overprint is still there**, so that was not the
  whole story and §16ab has what is left of the theory;
- `getcwd()` returned `A:\`, and upstream joins paths with `/` without ever
  testing for a separator already on the end, so `zfnqfp()` built
  `A:\/NAME` (§16ab). **That is what broke `CKICP FILE.KSC`.**

`KEEP_SPL` adds the script language for a further **+209,052**, and is
probably not worth it — `TAKE` is on the cheaper switch.

**§16x retracted the memory figure this project had used since §16a.**
396,224 was a FreeDOS measurement filed under an MS-DOS 3.1 heading; Victor
MS-DOS 3.1 gives **824,784 at 896K**, and the model is `free = installed RAM
− 92,720` because this DOS loads high. Measured at 256K and 896K; predicted
and confirmed that `CKERMITW` **does not load on a 256K machine** and does
on 512K. **Quote the requirement, not the spare** — `mzsize.py` now prints
the smallest Victor that can load a build, and that is the number to report.

---

## The harness had two defects, and both made a working port look broken

**1. The machine takes 40–85 seconds to start, and the host gives up first.**
`CKERMITW` is 205 KB and `CKICP` is 435 KB, read off SASI before `main()`
runs. On any leg where the **host** initiates, starting it too soon exhausts
`MAXTRY` (10, `ckcker.h:472`) against a Victor that has not reached `receive`
yet — **and a host that gives up looks exactly like a Victor that failed.**
Leg CE's timeout and leg CH's first attempt were both this. Fixed twice
over: the run sheet now states the wait explicitly, and every host take-file
where the host initiates carries `set retry 30`.

**2. The parser build asks two questions, and the redirect hides them.**
` Accept incoming file "A:/rcvch.dat"? ` and ` OK to exit? `. Redirected to
`STEP<LEG>.OUT` — which is *required*, because the `v9k:` counters only reach
stdout — both sit unanswered forever and the leg looks like a hang. `RXEA.KSC`
now carries `set receive confirm off` and `set exit warning off`.

**The mechanism is worth knowing, because it says something about the
shipping build too.** `fnrconfirm` is `CONFIRM_ON` **by default**
(`ckcmai.c:1408`), scope `LOCAL`, and a Victor driving its own serial line
*is* local — so `rq_confirm_check()` (`ckcfns.c:3567`) reaches the prompt on
**every `RECEIVE` this port has ever run.** `NOICP` builds survive only
because `ckvictor.c` supplies a `getyesno()` that returns yes; a `KEEP_ICP`
build links upstream's instead (`W1027`, decided by link order).

**So that stub is load-bearing and its comment said it was unreachable.**
Corrected in place. **A stub whose comment says it is unreachable has, by
construction, no test proving it** — this one was on the path of every
single receive leg in the project's history.

**And the general defect: the sheet optimised for capture, not visibility.**
Three artefacts per leg, all written to files, nothing on screen to say what
the machine was doing. Fine while everything works, useless the moment it
does not. **If a leg seems to hang, run the Victor side by hand without the
redirect before concluding anything** — that is how CH was diagnosed, and
what was behind the hang was a completely successful transfer.

---

## 1. Do this next, in priority order

**Items 1 through 4 are closed and item 5 is a standing decision, not a
task.** §16af emptied the repair queue, §16ag took the two cheap code
levers, and §16ah spent the bench sitting that items 1, 2 and 4 were
waiting for. What is left starts at **5a**, and the honest summary of it is
that the port has no known defect and no cheap lever — every remaining item
is either a measurement whose instrument is in question (5a, 5b, 9), a
feature nobody has needed yet (11, 12), or a confirmation run (7, 13, 14).

**Read item 5b before planning any of it.** The bench does not repeat to
better than ~1.3 s, which is larger than several of the effects the items
below propose to measure — including 5a's. Where that bites, the way out is
usually a counter rather than a clock.

---

**1. ~~Repeat legs AG and AH with the `.host` redirect.~~ DONE — §16ah legs
BA/BB, and the answer was not the one this item expected.**

The host clock was captured on all seven legs. BA failed to reproduce AG
(1 timeout, 2 resends, 40,555 wire bytes); **BB reproduced §16ae leg BX to
the byte** (37,523). The block-check cost therefore came from BB against
the clean block-3 legs BC and BD, same binary, same session:

| | block 1 | block 3 | Δ | µs / wire byte |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| BB → BC | 25.475 s | 28.057 s | **2.582 s** | **68.8** |
| BB → BD | 25.475 s | 29.334 s | **3.859 s** | **102.7** |

**§16af's 1.00 s / 26 µs / "at most 3.7%" is withdrawn. CRC-16 costs 10–15%
of the transfer.** Its conclusion survives — 10–15% is not 43%, and the case
for CRC-16 was never a speed case — but the number must not be quoted again.

**The µs-per-8088-cycle constant this item asked for was not obtained**, and
the reason is the bench spread above: the effect and the noise are the same
size. Getting it needs more legs per arm, not a better clock.

**2. ~~Send a 32 KB file BY NAME.~~ DONE — §16ah leg BS, and it delivered
both results it was sent for.**

**Upstream edit 16 is closed.** `-s RCVAG.DAT` on a file of exactly 32,768
bytes — inside the broken range — transferred byte-exact with **no error
line in `STEPBS.OUT` at all**. The signature it was watching for (`kermit
-s NAME:` with an empty message) did not appear. It was the last shipped
edit in this port with only a `wdis` reading behind it.

**And the port has a send measurement for the first time: 1,386 cps, the
fastest figure it has ever produced.**

| | sending (BS) | receiving (BC) |
|---|---:|---:|
| wire bytes for 32,768 | **40,726 (+24.3%)** | 35,950 (+9.7%) |
| non-line cost | **13.04 s** | 18.71 s |
| no-line ceiling | ~2,512 cps | ~1,751 cps |
| **cps** | **1,386** | 1,167 |

Sending beats receiving by 19% **while carrying 13% more traffic**, which
confirms from the other side that the receive foreground is the bottleneck.
**The open question it opens is item 5a.**

**3. ~~`NOCKXXCHAR`.~~ DONE AND SHIPPED, §16ag.** `ckcdeb.h:3390` turned
`CKXXCHAR` on for any build defining `UNIX`, putting a test on `ttinl()`'s
per-byte loop whose only setters are behind `#ifndef NOICP` and which could
therefore never be true. Now defined in `ckvictor.h`.

| | before | after | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| DGROUP | 48,816 (74%) | **48,304 (73%)** | −512 |
| file | 205,968 | 205,212 | −756 |
| needs at load | 220,160 (215K) | **219,452 (214K)** | −708 |

Those are the shipping figures today. −512 is exactly `short dblt[256]`,
repaying edit 17's CRC table to the byte;
`wdis` confirms `ignflag`/`dblt` leave `ckutio.obj` entirely; 19 warnings
unchanged. The throughput half is measured too: **−1.07 s, 2.1%, at 9600
under MAME**, two legs reproducing to 1 ms.

**It is `#ifndef KEEP_ICP`.** The first version shipped it unconditionally,
taking `SET SEND DOUBLE-CHARACTER` and `SET RECEIVE IGNORE-CHARACTER` out
of the parser build to save DGROUP in a build that has no parser — on an
invented premise that the parser is only an instrument. **It is a feature
this port intends to ship**; `ckvictor.h` calls `NOICP` the removal of "the
one thing this port most wants back". Guarded, `KEEP_ICP` needs **429,890
(419K), smallest Victor 512K** — the same smallest machine either way, so
the two commands cost margin, not reach.

**Read the 2.1% carefully, because §16ag does not claim it is the test.**
The change removes two instructions from the loop *and* 512 bytes of DGROUP
*and* 756 of code, and at 9600 the foreground has 555 µs of slack per byte,
so per-byte savings have room to hide. The size is the more likely
mechanism. The direction is not in doubt on any reading; the attribution is.

**4. ~~The `errno` far call.~~ REMOVED — §16ah leg 3. Do not reopen it
without reading that section first.**

Built in §16ag, verified in `wdis` (27 far calls leave `ckutio.obj`),
measured **98 ms slower** under MAME at 9600 and **350 ms slower** on the
bench at 38400 on the best-matched pair the harness can produce — BC against
BE, identical `rxbytes` (37,557), identical packet count, both 0/0, one
binary difference. Removed under the decision rule written into
`HW_TEST_16ag.md` *before* the legs ran.

**The caveat, so it is not discovered later:** the treatment arm was n = 1.
Leg BF went off-shape and was excluded. The decision rests on BE being the
best-matched leg available *and* on MAME agreeing. The way back is one
`git revert` and one more pair of legs.

**What it means for `ttinl()`:** the loop's per-byte cost is now known to be
resistant to two separate attacks (§16ag's `NOCKXXCHAR` gain is probably its
*size*, not its instructions; the `errno` far call removal is a measured
loss), which strengthens item 5's argument rather than weakening it.

**5. Do NOT spend edit 18 on `ttinl()`, and do not strip the ISR
counters — reasons, so the decision does not get re-litigated.**

What is left in `ttinl()`'s loop after items 3 and 4 is a redundant
double-mask and double-store of the same byte, and a `DS` reload for the
far destination pointer. A `VICTOR9K` fast path could collapse it. It is
still the wrong trade: it is the **packet reader**, stateful, with six
early-exit paths, whose failure modes are resync and truncation — things a
byte-exact transfer can *pass* while being subtly wrong. `chk3()` was
justifiable because it was self-contained arithmetic checkable exhaustively
on the host in milliseconds, and because computing a 16-bit CRC in `long`
is wrong everywhere and merely free on 32-bit machines. `ttinl()` is not
wrong; it is general. And with the ring no longer under pressure this buys
cps, not correctness — which is the thing §16ae showed this port
over-values.

The ISR's per-byte instrumentation is ~142 of ~678 cycles (the 32-bit
`rxbytes` add/adc, the occupancy subtract, the `rxpeak` and `stall256`
compares). **`rxfull` and `rxpeak` are the instruments that found and
confirmed the defect edit 17 just fixed**, and §16k put them in every build
because a run fast enough to measure cannot carry a debug log. If it is
ever worth doing, drop only the 32-bit `rxbytes` counter (it exists to give
`mapoffset.py` byte offsets) and keep the two that matter.

**5a. ~~Run a Victor send with `cautious` prefixing.~~ SUPERSEDED — the
Victor was never running `cautious`, and the fix is in the tree awaiting
legs CC/CD of `HW_TEST_16ai.md`.**

This item proposed running the arm it believed was already running.
`ckvictor.h` selects `PX_CAU`; `initproto()` overwrote it with `PX_ALL`
before anything read it; §16ah leg BS's "+24.3% against the host's +9.7%" is
therefore `PX_ALL` measured against `PX_CAU` and not two ends disagreeing
about one policy. The header of this file has the mechanism. **The figures
themselves are also withdrawn — 41,945 (+28.0%) and 37,585 (+14.7%) counted
from the logs, against `rxbytes` to the byte on leg BC.**

**What survives, and it is the part worth carrying forward:**

- **Run it as a wire-byte comparison, NOT a timing A/B.** The effect is
  ~4,400 wire bytes, ~1.1 s of line time at 38400, **below item 5b's ~1.3 s
  noise floor**. The clock cannot resolve it and more legs will not change
  that. `pktstat.py` counts prefixes and wire bytes exactly. **When the
  bench cannot resolve an effect in seconds, look for a counter that
  measures the same mechanism in units that do not vary.**
- **`PX_CAU` puts control characters on the wire raw**, which is the point
  of it and also the only way it can go wrong. `cmp` before the counts: a
  leg that is fast and wrong is the failure mode. XON/XOFF stay prefixed
  under `PX_CAU` regardless (`ckcmai.c:2731`), so flow control is not the
  exposure.
- **The control costs nothing extra.** `CKPXALL.EXE` is the same tree and
  the same 205,228 bytes, differing in one immediate constant, so §16w's
  code-size sensitivity has no purchase — unlike §16af, which had to spend a
  whole null leg establishing that.

**5b. Find out why this bench does not repeat, or stop quoting differences
smaller than 1.3 s.**

§16ah legs BC and BD: same binary, same block check, both 0 timeouts and 0
retransmissions, `rxbytes` **37,557 against 37,568** — and **1.277 s apart**.
BE and BF, same binary as each other, 1.310 s apart. §16ag's MAME arms held
to **1 ms and 5 ms**. So the bench's spread is ~250× the emulator's, and it
is the same size as the effect §16af tried to size and 5× the effect §16ag
tried to detect. **2 of 7 legs went off-shape** (1 timeout, 2 resends,
~40,55x wire bytes), against 1 of 7 under MAME.

Ruled out already: **the ring.** `rxpeak` is 2,4xx–2,6xx and `rxfull` is 0 in
every leg. Untested candidates: the host's round-trip estimator making
different decisions run to run (§16l established every timeout in these logs
is the host's, so this is the leading one), thermal or cable variation, and
the Pico SASI's write timing.

**Until this is understood, the rule is arithmetic and not judgement: an
A/B on this bench needs enough legs per arm that the standard error is below
the effect, and two is not enough for anything under ~1.3 s.**

---

### Standing items, renumbered 6 onward after §16af

**6. ~~The x1 sweep.~~ CLOSED 8 August 2026. Do not reopen it without
reading PORTING.md §11a0 first.**

**39,062.50 bps at count 2 is the hardware ceiling, and the port has shipped
it since §16o.** `bps = 1,250,000/(16 x count)`, count >= 2 because the 8253
is in Mode 3, and the operator traced the sheet: **the only path to the
7201's RxCA is through the 74LS90 chain** — no fixed tap around the 8253, no
external clock from the connector. The LS153 selects among LS90 outputs, not
around them.

x1 was tried properly and is not the way past it. It is a real async mode —
the datasheet permits it and a 32 KB **send** at x1 completed byte-exact —
but x1 *receive* accepted 33% of 110-byte packets where x16 was clean at a
three times worse rate mismatch, and closing the rate gap needs the two ends
matched to ~100 ppm against an FTDI that tunes in ~400 ppm steps.

`B57600`/`B76800`/`B115200` are **removed** from `victor/sys/termios.h` and
`__MAX_BAUD` is back to `B38400`. That removal matters: `ttspdlist()`,
`ttsspd()` and `ttgspd()` all key off those `#define`s, so defining one is
enough to let `SET SPEED` and `-b` offer a rate that cannot transfer.

The `XFLAGS="-dV9K_CLKBITS=0x00 -dV9K_COUNT=<n>"` override survives, so the
experiment is repeatable without shipping a broken speed.

**Three things are measurements now that were assumptions a week ago**, and
they are the value of the exercise: the 8253 sees exactly **1,250,000 Hz**
(LS153 15F pin 7, two counts, same product — which also settled the
1.25 vs 1.2288 MHz argument that ran through four documents); **every rate
on this machine is 1.72% fast** and no integer count fixes it, which is what
the x16 control's six errors in 32 KB were showing; and x1's envelope is
`P(packet) = (1 - 9 x rate_error)^L`.

**7. ~~Run the hardware leg for the parser.~~ CLOSED — §16bc leg HM.**
The post-merge `KEEP_ICP` build (460,466 bytes, needs 453,986 / 443K,
DGROUP 90%, **640K class**) ran `A:\SPDTEST.KSC` by absolute path on the
machine: `SHOW VERSIONS` named the build (edit 12), `SET LINE` reported
**local**, and **`SET SPEED 38400` and 19200 both read back** — edit 15 on
hardware at last, on the rate whose cast produced −2713. Edits 12, 13, 14
and 15 are now all confirmed on the machine. The text below is kept for the
staging method and the stale-binary trap it describes.

**7.0 — ~~PRECONDITION: rebuild and re-stage.~~ DONE 9 August 2026.** Both
binaries are rebuilt from HEAD, re-measured, staged and round-trip verified:
`CKICP.EXE` **435,154, md5 `f5456cae…`, needs 429,890 (419K), smallest
Victor 512K** with 1,678 bytes spare, and `CKICPD.EXE` **546,422, md5
`6d991fc7…`, needs 533,110 (520K), smallest Victor 640K** — which re-measures
the stale "532,904 / 640K" figure rather than re-quoting it. The rest of this
item is now `HW_TEST_16ai.md` legs CF, CG and CH. **The reasoning below is
kept because it is why the rebuild mattered, and because the same trap will
exist again the next time a binary sits on the image across an edit.**

| | landed | in the staged parser binaries? |
|---|---|---|
| edit 16 — `-s <name>` ≥ 32K | `d840218`, 8 Aug 17:49 | **no** |
| edit 17 — fast `chk3()` | `4610f2e`, 9 Aug 07:57 | **no** |
| §16ag `NOCKXXCHAR` (now `#ifndef KEEP_ICP`) | 9 Aug | no, and it is a wash — the guard means the parser build keeps `dblt` either way |

**Edit 17 is the one that matters and it is a trap, not an inconvenience.**
Without it, `chk3()` computes the CRC in `long` through two `long[16]`
tables, which is precisely the defect §16af found: at 38400 with block check
3 it pinned `rxpeak` at 4,095 of 4,096 and lost 556–649 bytes on three legs
of four. **The transfer leg below is at 38400.** Run it against the staged
binary and you would reproduce §16af's ring defect and read it as *"the
parser build breaks transfers"* — a wrong conclusion that would look
thoroughly convincing, because `rxfull` would be non-zero and the resends
real. Edit 16's absence is milder but the same shape: `-s <name>` on the
32 KB fixture would fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the parser.

**Measured from HEAD for the plain parser build, 9 August:** file 435,154,
DGROUP **59,024 of 65,536 (90%)**, needs **429,890 (419K)**, **smallest
Victor 512K**, 26 warnings. **`CKICPD` has not been rebuilt** — the 532,904
/ 640K figure quoted below and in §6 is the 8 August number and should be
re-measured, not re-quoted.

Then the leg itself. §16ad ran the whole sequence under MAME, so hardware is
confirmation rather than discovery: `CKICPD SPDTEST.KSC -d` and `CKICPD A:\SPDTEST.KSC -d` both
run the script; `SET LINE` reports local; **`SET SPEED 38400` and 19200 both
read back**, with `tcsetattr divisor=` 2 and 4; `SHOW VERSIONS` names the
machine; and the prompt echoes a typed line exactly once.

```
STEPSPD                       (at A>)
CKICPD -d                     (at A>)
take spdtest.ksc              (at the C-Kermit> prompt)
REN DEBUG.LOG SPD3.LOG        (at A>, after Kermit exits)
```

The image was cleaned of `SPD*` and `DEBUG.LOG` after the MAME run, so the
`REN`s will succeed.

What MAME could not settle:

- **Extended keys.** The console now reads INT 21h AH=07h. Whether the
  Victor's keyboard driver uses the 0-then-scan-code convention is unknown,
  so a function or arrow key may deliver a stray NUL. Nothing in this build
  wants arrow keys; it is a "do not be surprised" note.
- **The echo control.** The pre-§16ac binary has never been under MAME, so
  §16ad shows the fix behaving correctly rather than the bug reproducing and
  then going away.
- **A transfer.** Edit 14 widened what `main()` compiles and the shipping
  binary is no longer the one measured at 1,170 cps. `dofast()` is guarded
  out on purpose (§8 item 14), but one 32 KB leg reporting `rxlost=0
  rxfull=0` and a byte-exact md5 is what says the wire protocol did not
  move.

**8. Report edits 14, 15, 16 and 17 upstream — plus the two `ckutio.c`
defects §16aj found and did NOT fix, and the `ckcfns.c` one §16aw found.**

The two flow-control ones are not 16-bit defects, and neither is specific to
this port:

- **`ckutio.c:6758`** — `ttpkt()`'s `TESTING234` block clears `IXON|IXOFF`
  out of `ttraw` unconditionally, four lines before the `tcsetattr()` that
  applies it and 141 lines after the `FLO_XONX` arm set them. `SET FLOW
  XON/XOFF` therefore cannot reach a driver through termios on any build
  taking the `BSD44ORPOSIX` arm. It is an `if (1)` inside an `#ifdef` of
  its own `#define` — a debugging block left switched on. **Not fixed
  here: it is not a guarded no-op, it changes behaviour everywhere, and
  hard rule 1 says say so rather than do it.**
- **`ckutio.c:10849`** — `ttoc()`'s `tcflow(ttyfd,TCOON)`, the POSIX
  recovery from a lost XON, is the argument of a `debug()` call, so
  `NODEBUG` discards it. It is the only caller of `tcflow()` in the
  module. `ckvictor.c`'s `V9K_FCSPIN` is the port's own backstop for it.
- **`ckufio.c`'s `zchko()`** — the writability probe **creates a file and
  deletes it again**, on every received file, before any data moves, purely
  so it can call `isatty()` on the descriptor (the `NOUUCP` arm, which this
  port takes). The function's own header comment opens **"NOTE: The design
  is flawed."** Cheap on POSIX; on a FAT12 root with 156 entries it is a
  free-slot scan plus two directory writes and **§16bc measured it at
  ~4.4 s per file**, fixed and rate-independent. Worth reporting for the
  danger as much as the cost: the same function already carries a 2022 fix
  and a long comment about **not** destroying a pre-existing file, which is
  exactly the failure mode "test writability by creating the file" invites.
  A stat of the parent directory answers the question the probe is asking.
  **Not fixed here** — it is upstream's design decision, and this port has
  no reason to be the one to change it. §16bc.

- **`ckcfns.c:6914`** — `snddir()` has an `if` with no body:

  ```c
      if (zfnqfp(name,CKMAXPATH,fnbuf))

      debug(F110,"snddir name 2",name,0);
  ```

  `debug()` carries its own `;` in every build, so the body is an empty
  statement and this compiles clean and silent — but `zfnqfp()`'s result is
  discarded, and eight lines later `fnbuf` is the `%s` of the listing's
  `"Listing files: %s"` header. On the failure path that is an
  **uninitialised automatic**, so the header prints stack contents and
  `sprintf` runs to whatever NUL it finds. Found by §16aw while reading the
  function for an unrelated reason; harmless on the path this port takes,
  because `zfnqfp()` succeeds. **Not fixed here** — it needs a decision
  about what the header should say when qualification fails, which is
  upstream's to make.

Then the four edits. Two independent defects, both found only because this
port is an unusual build, and neither specific to it:

- **14** — `ckcmai.c`'s `#ifndef NOTCPIP` has been mis-nested for a very
  long time and disables two documented features, the init file and a
  command file named on the command line, in every configuration that turns
  TCP/IP off. §8 item 14 and §16ac have the analysis, including why the
  drifted-closer reading is the right one. Item 8 of this list used to
  cover the `dofast()` half of the same region; one report now.
- **15** — `ckuus5.c`'s `(int) ss[i] / 10` casts before dividing, so `SET
  SPEED` is broken for every rate above 32767 on any 16-bit target. §8
  item 15.
- **16** — `ckuusy.c:3690` stores `zchki()`'s `CK_OFF_T` return, which is
  the *file size*, in a 16-bit `int`, so `-s <name>` refuses any file of
  32,768 bytes or more. **Made, and now run** — §16ah leg BS sent exactly
  32,768 bytes by name, byte-exact, no error line. `wdis` confirms a signed
  32-bit compare where `dx` used to be discarded.
- **17** — `ckcfn2.c`'s `chk3()` computes a 16-bit CRC in `long` through
  two `long[16]` tables. Correct everywhere, and on any 16-bit target with
  no shift-by-immediate it costs two software shift loops per byte. **This
  one is different in kind from 14–16**: they are defects, it is an
  optimisation, and the `#ifdef VICTOR9K` guard is there for that reason
  rather than from necessity. Offer it as a portability improvement with
  the measurement attached (§16af), not as a bug report — upstream has no
  obligation to carry a second table for one CPU.

All three are the same species: a value that needs more than 16 bits
assigned to an `int`. A 16-bit build is the only place they show, which is
why this port keeps finding them.

**8a. `-s` for files of 32,768 bytes or more — the analysis, kept because it
is what to send upstream. VERIFIED ON HARDWARE, §16ah leg BS.**

```c
int fil2snd, rc;                                   /* ckuusy.c:3690 */
...
if ((rc = zchki(*xargv)) > -1 || (rc == -2))       /* ckuusy.c:3726 */
```

`zchki()` returns `CK_OFF_T` — **4 bytes here, measured** — and on success it
returns the **file size** (`ckufio.c:2477`). Assigned to a 16-bit `int`, a
32,768-byte file becomes **-32768**, which is neither `> -1` nor `-2`, so the
send falls through to the failure branch. `zchki()` had *succeeded*, which is
why the error line reads

```
kermit -s TRANS.DAT:
```

with nothing after the colon: nothing set `errno`, because nothing failed.
**An empty `ck_errstr()` on that line is the signature** — it means the file
was found and the caller threw the answer away.

It is periodic, not a simple threshold, because the wrap repeats every 64K:

| size | as int16 | `-s <name>` |
|---:|---:|---|
| 32,767 | 32,767 | works |
| 32,768 | -32,768 | **fails** |
| 65,535 | -1 | **fails** |
| 65,536 | 0 | works |
| 98,304 | -32,768 | **fails** |

**Why it went four sections unnoticed.** §16d sent `TESTFILE.TXT`, 74 bytes.
§16g used `-s *.TXT`, and wildcards take the `nzxpand()` branch — which is
only reached *because* `zchki` appeared to fail, so the wildcard path routes
around the bug. And every 32 KB test this port has run was a **receive**;
`zchki` is not in that path. **The port has never sent a large file by
name.**

Fix: declare `rc` as `CK_OFF_T`. A no-op wherever `int` is 32 bits, so like
edit 15 it should not be guarded — guarding it would ship the broken form
everywhere else. Send it upstream with 14 and 15; all three are plain 16-bit
portability defects.

**Workaround in any unfixed build:** use a wildcard. `-s TRANS.*` transfers
the same 32 KB file correctly, because it reaches `nzxpand()`.

**Then prove it end to end**, because that is the point: a take-file on the
Victor doing `set speed`, `send`, `statistics`. `TAKE` from the prompt
already works, so this is available now and does not wait on item 0.

**Three rules for writing them**, all learned the hard way:

- **CRLF** line endings (`PTEST.KSC` is CRLF and works, and `_fmode` is
  `O_BINARY` here so it is not obvious that it should).
- **Never end a line with `-`** — that is C-Kermit's continuation
  character, and it silently ate four commands out of §16z's test script.
- **The filename must be argv[1] literally.** `prescan()`'s branch is
  guarded by `yargc > 1 && *yargv[1] != '-'` (`ckuus4.c:1610`), so
  `CKICPD -d FILE.KSC` never takes it. Put switches after.

---

**9a-bis. The foreground bucket is now SPLIT, and the instrument has a
caveat — §16ar.** `v9k: dec n= max= at #= tot= to=` measures last byte of a
packet handed up to the ACK for it handed down: decode, the file write and
the protocol state machine, which at a window of one is exactly the time a
window would have to overlap. **It cannot tell a decode from a silence** —
all four §16ar legs read `max = 3250 cs`, 32.5 s, and the guard built for
it read `to = 0` because §16l's finding still holds and **every timeout in
these logs is the host's**, so our alarm never fires. Subtracting `max` by
hand gives 64.6 and 73.2 cs against the **68.2 cs `rxpeak / line rate`
gives independently**. **Quote `rxpeak`; `dec` corroborates, it does not
adjudicate** — §16ai's rule applied to this port's own instrument.

**9. ~~The foreground decode path.~~ EDIT 18 TOOK 25.6% OF IT — §16aq.**
`ttinl()`'s per-byte loop was ~133 µs of the ~485 µs per wire byte; the bulk
arm removed 5.48 s of a 31.14 s receive. **What is left is `rpack()`,
`decode()`, `zmchout()` and the protocol state machine, and item 5's argument
against touching `ttinl()` further still holds** — what edit 18 did was
bypass the loop wholesale for the body of a packet, not micro-optimise it.
**The next lever is not in this path at all; it is item 12.**

**9a. The old item 9, kept because its framing is still right. §16af moved every
number in this item — the breakdown below is leg AG, not §16v's leg CA.**
**1,170 cps at 38400** with CRC-16, byte-exact, zero retransmissions.
Where 28.00 s goes:

```
line time (37,568 B at 38400)      9.77 s   35%
disk      (wfile tot = 50 cs)      0.50 s    2%
txgap     (ACK-sent to next-read)  0.00 s    0%   <- was 2.50 s at 18 pkts
unaccounted                       17.73 s   63%   <- packet decoding
```

The proportion barely moved (62% → 63%) while the absolute fell 21.2 → 17.7
s, which is the honest way to read edit 17: **it did not change what the
bottleneck is, only how much of it there is.** Per wire byte the foreground
is ~485 µs, down from §16v's 564, and the **no-line ceiling is ~1,797 cps**
— §16v's ~1,353 is superseded and should not be quoted.

`peaktag = 12` names it — upstream, after a ring drain. That is **564 µs
per received byte, ~2,800 cycles on a 5 MHz 8088, against a 260 µs byte
time**: the same shape as §16t's ISR defect one level up, and the reason
`rxpeak` sits at 2,589 without ever overflowing.

**The number that should govern every throughput decision from here is the
no-line ceiling: ~1,797 cps** (leg AG; AH's is ~1,900). Take the wire out
entirely and 18.2 s remain. §16v's ~1,353 was the same calculation on the
pre-edit-17 binary and is superseded. §16n's ~1,630 projection is above it and is dead; §16t's ≤ 2,780
ceiling was loose by 2.7×. Doubling 19200 → 38400 bought **+24%** measured,
**+17%** after correcting leg CB for its two retransmissions. **Nothing
above 38400 is worth more than 34%**, so rate is finished as a lever.

**The compile flag has been tried and it is not the lever — see §16w
before spending anything here.** `-ot` fits (needs 235,090, DGROUP
48,576) and is **slower**: 632 → 624 cps and `rxpeak` 294 → 333 on
protocol-identical runs. §16t's own model predicts it — an 8088 fetches
through a four-byte queue over an 8-bit bus at ~4 clocks a byte, so **code
size is execution time** and `-ot`'s 9.2% of extra far code is a cost. The
MAME caveat runs in the safe direction for once. `-os` stays, and the
makefile now says why on both grounds.

**Both cheap levers are spent, and the decode path is now upstream code.**
§1 item 3 shipped `NOCKXXCHAR`; §1 item 4 built the `errno` far-call removal
and §16ah took it back out for measuring slower on both instruments. What is
left in `ttinl()`'s loop is upstream's, and **§1 item 5 argues against
spending edit 18 on it** — an argument the two failed attacks strengthen
rather than weaken. Two things to do before anything expensive:

- **Split the 17.7 s.** It is one subtraction — elapsed minus line minus
  `wfile` minus `txgap` — so nothing yet separates per-byte decode from
  per-packet fixed cost, and the two have completely different fixes. A tag
  or counter around the decode call splits it. §16m's rule applies: the
  interrupt handler is a clock you can afford, the foreground is not, so
  instrument at packet granularity and not per byte. **§16af makes this
  more attractive than it was**: with resends gone, packet count is now a
  clean 18 in every leg, so a per-packet fixed cost divides out exactly.
- **Run a text fixture, because every measurement this port has is on
  adversarial data.** The 32,768-byte fixture holds every byte value, so
  Kermit's control and high-bit prefixing expands it to **37,568 wire
  bytes, 14.7%** — and decode cost is per *wire* byte. Plain ASCII should
  present materially fewer. That is an inference from the packet logs
  bounding it at ~15%, **not a measurement**, and one run settles it. It
  also means **1,170 cps is a worst-case-ish figure**, which is the right
  one to quote but not the whole picture.

**10. ~~Re-do the ring sizing.~~ LARGELY CLOSED by §16af — `rxpeak` is
2,581 of 4,096 with 1,515 bytes of margin and `rxfull = 0` at block 3, so
nothing is pressing on the ring and there is no sizing crisis to resolve.
What survives is the model below and the `DRPSIZ` ceiling in item 11; the
0.54-bytes-per-byte figure is now wrong in magnitude (the foreground fell
from 564 to ~485 µs a byte) though right in shape. An earlier revision said
"do not re-derive it until item 1 has produced a calibration"; **item 1 is
closed and produced no calibration** — the bench spread and the effect are
the same size (§16ah) — so that gate never opens and is withdrawn. If this
model is ever wanted, the thing to derive it from is `rxpeak`, which is
counted exactly and does not care about the timing noise.**

The superseded reasoning, kept because the *method* is still the right one: The peak is `rxpeak = 2,589 of 4,096` at 38400 (§16t's 2,621 on
the same leg; two samples, same place). `peaktag = 12` is packet decoding,
and §16v says why: the foreground runs at 564 µs a byte against a 260 µs
byte time, so during a packet it falls behind at about **0.54 bytes per
byte received** and catches up in the silence after. That predicts

```
rxpeak ~= 0.54 x packet length      3,991 x 0.54 = 2,155, measured 2,589
```

which is the right shape and about 20% low, so treat 0.54 as a floor. The
useful consequence is that **the peak now scales with packet length**, which
§16k's argument could not say. It is a model to test, not a result: one run
at `XFLAGS=-dDRPSIZ=2000` would confirm or kill it cheaply, and the rule
still stands that no packet-length change ships without a run that reaches
FINISH and reports `rxlost`/`rxfull`/`rxpeak`.

Note this bounds *observed* occupancy, not the safe bound — the worst case
is still "the foreground drains nothing for a whole packet", which is the
packet length, and it is **item 11** that turns on it. (This used to say
"item 3", from a numbering two revisions old.)

**11a. §16bc SETTLES WHY EVERY RTS/CTS LEG HAS BEEN NULL, AND IT IS NOT
THE HOST.** With a client carrying a verified `POSIX_CRTSCTS` (see lead
item 4), leg HD reports **`held=0 rel=0`**: `rxpeak` reached 2,635 against
a high mark of 3,072, so **the water mark was never crossed and RTS was
never asserted.** At 38400 with a window of 1 the ring cannot fill to
three-quarters, because the far end stops to wait for an ACK long before
that — §16au's regime fact from a third direction. **A flow-control leg at
the shipping marks cannot engage flow control.** `V9K_FLOW` stays
`FLO_NONE`. **What is left is one narrow question**: whether lowering the
marks buys anything a window of 1 has not already bought — and §16ak showed
low marks (256/64) void the leg the other way by putting `rxpeak` inside a
resend. If it is ever run again, it needs a *narrow band* high up, a staged
binary carrying the `-d` flags, and an adjacent control. Leg HE is the one
positive: **`xon=2`**, two host START characters intercepted by the ISR,
costing nothing (27.803 s against its control's 27.746).

**11. ~~Flow control.~~ BUILT, SHIPPED OFF, AND NOW MEASURED ON THE
MACHINE — PORTING.md §16aj (build), §16ak (seven legs), §16al (four legs).**

`ckvictor.c` §1f is the driver: **RTS/CTS and XON/XOFF, both directions, in
both interrupt handlers**, selected by `--rtscts` / `--xonxoff` /
`--noflow` off the DOS command tail (§16i's priority-0 XI mechanism) or by
`-dV9K_FLOW=`. Water marks 3/4 and 1/4. Assert in the handler because the
case it exists for is the one where the foreground is not running; release
in `v9k_ser_get()`. `tcflow()` implemented. **No upstream edit — still
seventeen.**

**What eleven bench legs settled:**

| | answer | leg |
|---|---|---|
| does the CTS gate wedge the transmitter? | **no** — 32,768 bytes at **1,475 cps**, the port's fastest | §16ak DS |
| does turning it on cost anything? | **no** — byte-identical to its control, **6 ms** apart | §16ak DE |
| what does §1f itself cost? | **≤ 0.11 s on a 32 KB receive**, ~3 µs/wire byte | §16al GP/GQ |
| **does our RTS pin actually move?** | **YES — on a scope. Eight pauses of 785 ms–1 s during leg GB** | §16an |
| **does the far end stop?** | **no, and it is the HOST** — data kept arriving hundreds of ms after each drop, because macOS was never told to watch CTS | §16an |
| does the Victor obey a real XOFF? | **unknown** — the host never sent one | §16ak DX |

**`V9K_FLOW` stays `FLO_NONE`.** The **input** half of RTS/CTS works and is
fast; the **output** half has never actually been tested — see §16am.

**§16an put a logic analyzer on the pin and the port's half works.** The
Victor's RTS is negative before any driver, positive once the OEM driver
loads, blips on every chip reprogram, drops 175 µs on each `HANGUP`, and —
the one that matters — **shows eight pauses of 785 ms to ~1 s during §16al
leg GB**, which is §1f dropping RTS at the 1,024 mark and raising it at 896
on a clean byte-exact 32 KB transfer. **Data kept arriving for hundreds of
milliseconds after each drop**, because the bench Mac's C-Kermit has no
`POSIX_CRTSCTS`, its `tthflow()` is an empty function, and nothing was ever
told to watch that pin (§16am).

**Three candidates are down to one and it is not ours:** the WR5 write
reaches the pin (dead), the cable carries it (strongly indicated — §16an has
a 25 ms tell where `cts` lags `dsr`/`dcd`, and **one two-probe capture at
both ends of the CTS conductor during a `STEPGB` run closes it**), and the
host does not act on CTS (**this is it**).

**So the default waits on the host, not on the port.** The risk that chose
`FLO_NONE` — gating the transmitter on an unmeasured CTS — is retired. What
is missing is the benefit: no far end has been shown to stop because the
only one tested cannot be. `stty -f <port> crtscts -hupcl` before `kermit`
is untested and free; a host C-Kermit built from this tree with
`POSIX_CRTSCTS` is the honest fix. **XON/XOFF has no `stty` shortcut** — its
bits are exactly the `c_iflag` ones `TESTING234` clears.

**And the analyzer found something it was not aimed at: `msleep()` does not
sleep.** The 175 µs `HANGUP` pulse should be 500 ms (`HUPTIME`). This build
has no `select`/`nanosleep`/`usleep`, so `msleep()` compiles upstream's
fallback — `if (m > 0) while (m > 0) m--;` — an empty loop on a local that
`-os` may delete outright. **`tthang()` cannot hang up a modem and
`tcsendbreak()` does not send a break**, and the second is `ckvictor.c` §1b's
own code. See §1 item 16 and the known-incomplete list.

**The instrument lesson is the one to carry:** every flow-control
measurement before this was a counter inside one of the two programs, and
**both programs can be right about what they did while nothing happens
between them.** When the question is about a wire, measure the wire.
`stty` shortcut: its bits are exactly the ones `TESTING234` clears.

**Three method points, all from §16al and all reusable:**

0. **Before running an experiment that depends on the far end behaving a
   particular way, measure that the far end can.** §16aj wrote down "a line
   of upstream source is not evidence that the build compiles it" about this
   port's own build; §16am is the same rule pointed at the *other end of the
   wire*, and **`SHOW FEATURES` is `wcc -pl` for a binary you did not
   build**. Three legs and a fourth about to be scheduled went to finding
   that out afterwards, and the check was one command.
1. **Non-line cost is how you compare an off-shape leg.** Host clock minus
   wire bytes × 260 µs made leg GP usable when its clock alone was not, and
   it is what turned §16ak's unattributable +11% into a withdrawn figure.
2. **When a leg keeps going off-shape, change what you ask of it, not how
   many times you ask.** A narrow band (1024/896) gives a **cap** to read
   where a low mark (256/64) gave a comparison, and a cap survives a
   retransmission.
3. **The bench's run-to-run spread is the HOST.** The same `CKPRE` binary
   had a non-line cost of **18.29 s in §16ah and 21.43 s in §16al** with the
   wire held constant — 172 ms per packet of macOS/USB turnaround. That is
   the standing answer to item 5b and the reason adjacent pairs work and
   cross-sitting comparisons do not.

**Two upstream defects came out of building it**, both in `ckutio.c`, both
found by preprocessing and both on item 8's report list: `:6758`'s
`TESTING234` block clears `IXON|IXOFF` four lines before the `tcsetattr()`
that applies them, and `:10849`'s `tcflow(TCOON)` — the only caller in the
module — sits inside a `debug()` argument that `NODEBUG` deletes. So §1f
reads upstream's **`flow`** variable, not the termios bits. **Do not quote
`ckutio.c:6252`/`:6617` as "the plumbing is already there".**

**Withdrawn:** §16ak's "+11% for §1f". **Isolated, not explained:** §16ak's
`stall256 = 2,399` on leg DB, which §16al did not reproduce (GB 47, GA 114)
— it belongs to the 256/64 configuration, where the high mark and
`V9K_RXSTALL` are the same number, and **is not evidence that anything
paused.**

**Three harness failures cost three sittings in this sequence, and all three
are worth remembering as rules rather than as anecdotes:** a re-run into a
target name that already existed (`SET FILE COLLISION BACKUP` cannot work on
FAT — put `IF EXIST <target> DEL <target>` in every receive `.BAT`); a run
sheet that named a `-d` flag without staging the binary carrying it; and **a
full image** (`vtg_image_util info` belongs in every §0 — partition 1 is
9.7 MB and 100% free and has never been used).

**12. WINDOWS — CLOSED FOR GOOD. §16au. The window fits, works, and is
worth 1 ms.**

**Eight bench legs at 38400, all byte-exact, `rxfull = 0` on every one.**
Route B (ring 8,192, `DRPSIZ` 3,800): **25.789 s at window 1 against
25.788 / 25.804 at window 2.** Route A (ring 4,096, `DRPSIZ` 1,800):
26.438 against 26.423 / 26.405. **Leg BD reproduces §16as leg XD to 3 ms**,
so growing the ring on its own changes nothing either. **Nothing ships:
`DFWSIZ` 1, `DRPSIZ` 4000, `V9K_RXBUFSIZ` 4096.**

**The W × L bound was right** — `rxpeak` 3,011/2,607 against route A's
3,596 and 4,380/4,756 against route B's 7,616 — and **the window is
genuinely open**, `rxpeak` rising 7.8× from 558 to 4,380.

**THE MODEL THIS ITEM RESTED ON SINCE §16v IS RETRACTED.** "Line and
foreground are strictly serialized, so overlapping them takes 25.66 s
toward ~16 s" — **they were already overlapped.** `ttinl()` processes bytes
as they arrive, so the 9.77 s of "line time" is not idle waiting for the
wire, it is the CPU busy in the ISR and the per-byte loop. **The ~16 s
ceiling this item chased for six sections does not exist.** The legs show
it directly: with the window open `dec` grows 16.00 → 17.50 s while
non-line cost holds at 16.02 — 1.5 s of reception moved into the decode
interval and the decode interval grew by exactly that.

> **On a single-CPU machine with no DMA the "I/O" IS CPU work, in an ISR.
> Overlapping I/O with compute cannot create capacity, only relabel which
> bucket the cycles fall in. The only lever is doing less work per byte.**

**Test any future throughput idea against that sentence before building
it.** It is why edits 17 and 18 worked and this did not.

**Item 9's number is measured at last: ~65 ms per packet** (BD 18 packets /
25.789 s against ZD 28 / 26.438, wire within 110 bytes, both 0/0). That
**retracts §16at's 139–167 ms**, fitted from timeout-contaminated MAME
legs. **It also kills route C on evidence**: `DRPSIZ` 8000 would save ~9
packets = 0.6 s for 12,288 bytes of DGROUP, and the per-packet term is only
~1.2 s of a 25.8 s transfer — **`DRPSIZ` 4000 is already near-optimal.**

**Three predictions wrong on one item** — §16ar's ring (regime error),
§16at's ~17 s (model error), §16at's per-packet cost (contaminated fit).
**A number quoted for six sections is not thereby a measurement**: "line
and foreground are serialized" was an inference from a subtraction that
was consistent with both models, and nobody tested it until now.

**Kept because they cost nothing and are correct and tested:**
`--window=N` with the two-ceiling clamp, `V9K_RXBUFSIZ` as a build lever
(`RXMASK` in the makefile), and the install-time mask check that leg WM
proved fires. The next person to wonder about windows answers it in one leg.

<details>
<summary>Superseded: §16at's plan, kept for the build detail</summary>

**§16as's defect was the RING, and the fix is to shorten the packet rather
than grow the ring.** A window of W lets the far end hold W unacknowledged
packets, so in-flight is **hard-bounded at W × (packet wire length)** and
the ring must hold all of it. At the shipping `DRPSIZ = 4000` that is
**2 × 3,998 = 7,996 into 4,096** — the ring ceiling is **1**, so this build
cannot usefully open a window at all. At **`DRPSIZ = 1800` it is 3,596 into
4,096**, 500 bytes of margin, **and it is a bound rather than an estimate.**

**It costs nothing**: `CKWIN18.EXE` is 226,972 with DGROUP 48,784, the same
as shipping, because `DRPSIZ` only moves immediates. Growing the ring
instead would cost 4,096 of DGROUP **and** an edit to `ckvisr.asm`.
**And it makes the window its own flow control** — the far end cannot run
ahead whatever it does — which **sidesteps the §16am/§16an blocker
entirely.** That blocker was never the only route, it was the only route
*at DRPSIZ 4000*.

**Verified under MAME (§16at legs YA/YB): `rxfull = 0`, `rxpeak = 635`**,
against §16as's pinned 4,095 and `rxfull` 179 at the same window. Both
byte-exact, `neg=2`, `pool=4 ring=2`.

**The clamp now checks both ceilings and prints them separately** —
`v9k: window ask= use= neg= pool= ring=` — because a single `cap=` hid
which one bit, and checking only the pool is what cost §16as its sitting.
`v9k/proofs/vwindow.c` covers the ceiling across seven `DRPSIZ` values.

**Bench prediction: ~18.5 s and ~1,770 cps against leg XD's 25.786 and
1,271, about +39%.** Ordering argument, not a magnitude. **`rxfull = 0` is
the part that is a bound**, and it is what the sitting should check first —
if it is non-zero the model is wrong and nothing else is interpretable.

**A number for item 9 fell out**: ~167 ms per packet of fixed foreground
cost (25 packets/15.5 s against 37/17.5 s), the per-byte/per-packet split
wanted since §16v. Indicative — both legs carried timeouts. **§16au
retracts it: the clean bench figure is 65 ms.**

<details>
<summary>§16as: why a window at the shipping DRPSIZ lost 9.3%</summary>

**Five bench legs at 38400, all byte-exact: a window of 2 is 9.3% SLOWER
and moves 21.4% more wire bytes.** 25.786 s → 28.19 s, 1,271 cps → 1,162,
37,557 wire bytes → 45,577. `rxpeak` **pinned at 4,095 of 4,096** with
`rxfull` 179–182. **`DFWSIZ` stays at 1.** The `--window=N` switch stays —
the default is unchanged and one leg reopens the question if flow control
ever lands.

**It gained no overlap at all**, which is the finding: non-line cost was
**16.021 s at window 1 and 16.333/16.349 at window 2.** It did not fall.

**Why, in one line: the receiver is 1.64× SLOWER than the line at 38400**
(427 µs of foreground per wire byte against 260 µs), so a window does not
overlap anything, it just fills the ring until it pins. At 9600 the
receiver is 2.4× *faster*, which is why §16ar's MAME legs looked fine.
**Item 12's premise — overlap takes 25.66 s toward ~16 s — is
arithmetically right and out of reach**: the buffer would have to hold the
6.2 s difference, about **24 KB**, against a 4,096-byte ring in a segment
with 16,752 bytes free in total. **The ~16 s ceiling is real; a window is
not the way to it. Making the foreground faster is** — which is what edit
18 did.

**§16ar's prediction (`rxpeak` 2,600–3,100, `rxfull` 0) is RETRACTED**, and
the error is worth more than the legs: it modelled occupancy as one
decode's worth of arrivals and scaled a 9600 measurement by 4, which is
valid **only where the receiver keeps up with the line** — the ring drains
between packets there and does not here. The real bound is **window ×
packet length, 2 × 3,991 = 7,982 into 4,096.** **A number measured on one
side of a regime boundary cannot be scaled across it.**

**Leg XF says flow control is still the blocker.** `held=2 rel=2` — our
RTS asserted and released correctly — and the wire came back **byte-
identical to the legs without it**, `rxfull` *worse* at 282. §16am/§16an a
third time. **A window pays only if the far end can be made to stop**; with
that, the ring holds one round trip instead of 24 KB and this is one leg
from a real result. That blocker has been the same since §16ak.

**`dec` came out well and item 9 has its first direct number**: on the
clean control, `dec tot` = 16.50 s against 16.021 s of non-line cost by
subtraction — one quantum apart, two independent routes — which confirms
the subtraction every figure in §16v, §16af and §16aq rested on.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Superseded: what §16ar established under MAME (kept for the build detail)</summary>

**`--window=N` is a run-time switch on the shipping binary, negotiated end
to end, byte-exact, for NO UPSTREAM EDIT — still eighteen.** DGROUP 48,784
(74%), image 226,936, needs 240,984 (235K), **smallest Victor 384K,
unchanged**. **`DFWSIZ` is still 1 in the tree**: §16ar built the lever and
measured it, it did not change the default.

**Four MAME legs at 9600, two arms, and the two runs of each arm reproduce
TO THE BYTE.** Window 2 negotiated on both ends independently — the
Victor's `neg=2` and the host's `window slots used: 2 of 30` — byte-exact,
`rxlost = 0 rxfull = 0`, `pktstat.py --rxbytes` reconciling at the usual
−11. **`rxpeak` 305 → 655**, and `mapoffset.py` puts the peak inside
**seq=20, an ordinary 3,396-byte data packet and not a resend**, so it is
steady-state occupancy. `r_pkt[]`/`rseqtbl[]` had never run in this port
before.

**The number to act on: predicted `rxpeak` at 38400 with a window of 2 is
2,600–3,100 of 4,096** — 655 scaled by 4× for the rate and again for the
longer packet the bench negotiates. That is comparable to §16af's clean
2,581 and leaves ~1,000–1,500 bytes, so **the bench leg can be run without
growing the ring first** — which matters, because `V9K_RXBUFSIZ` is `.bss`
in DGROUP *and* `ckvisr.asm` holds `V9K_RXMASK` as a literal `0FFFh`, so
4,096 → 8,192 is an assembly change and not a constant. **It is arithmetic
on one measured number; the bench leg reports `rxpeak` itself.**

**9600 cannot show the payoff and did not.** Non-line cost was 39.0/41.6 s
at window 1 against 32.9/41.4 at window 2 — arms overlapping completely,
**within-arm spread up to 8.5 s** on identical byte counts. §16al's finding
reproduced on the emulator: **the spread is the host.** No cps figure from
that sitting is a window result.

**What is left is one bench sitting at 38400**: `--window=1` against
`--window=2`, adjacent, same binary, reading `neg` first, then
`rxlost`/`rxfull`/`rxpeak`, then the clock. Turn flow control on in the
same sitting — **and §16an says configure the HOST for it too**
(`stty -f <port> crtscts -hupcl` before `kermit`), because the bench Mac's
C-Kermit has no `POSIX_CRTSCTS` and its `tthflow()` is empty (§16am).

Note the interaction §16s found: with a window of one the file write
happens *before* `ack()`, so the line is idle through it — which is why a
floppy with 1.5-second writes loses nothing. **Open the window and that
stops being true**, and a 1.5 s write at 38400 is 5,760 bytes against a
4,096-byte ring. Nothing has tested that combination.

**Two traps §16ar walked up to, one of them seen in advance.** The switch
writes `ptab[PROTO_K].winsize` and not `wslotr`, because `initproto()`
copies the first over the second 118 lines before anything reads it — the
§16ai trap, caught this time before it cost a leg. And **the pool is the
ceiling at 2**: nothing in this build calls `adjpkl()` on the receive side,
so `(DRPSIZ + 6) × slots <= RBSIZ` is the port's own check, 4,006 × 2 =
8,012 ≤ 8,192. A window of 3 needs bigger pools, which are far heap and
cost load RAM rather than DGROUP — **and §16as says do not, since a window
of 2 already loses.**

</details>

**13. ~~Server mode on hardware.~~ DONE — §16ai leg CS, and it was a
first.** `CKERMITW -x` driven entirely from the host: SEND to the server
**1,058 cps**, GET from the server **1,431 cps**, then FINISH. Both
`SUCCESS`, both byte-exact, `rxlost = 0 rxfull = 0 rxpeak = 2,332`. **No E
packet**, so §16i's priority-0 capability initializer works on the machine —
a second, independent check on the XI mechanism whose failure §16ai's
headline was about. `HW_TESTING.md` leg 0.7 is closed.

**`--safe-server` is no longer unrun — §16av leg NS closed it.** Driven
entirely from the host at 9600 under MAME: `send rcvns.dat` to the server
came back **byte-exact md5**, `remote directory` was refused with
`E REMOTE DIRECTORY disabled`, and `finish` was honoured (`GF` → `Y`). The
unknown-option control ran too (§16i's rule): leg NX, `--safe-serverz`,
printed `Extended options not configured`, so the switch was parsed rather
than silently ignored. **One thing it exposed:** a `--safe-server` has
`en_del` off, and `ckcpro.c:502` then forces FILE COLLISION to RENAME,
which cannot work on FAT — leg NS reported `v9k: coll=0`. §16av part 2.

What is left of it: `REMOTE DIRECTORY` and `BYE` were
excluded deliberately — the first never terminates its listing (§16i, item
15) and the second cannot be retried without a power cycle.

**14. ~~FreeDOS for Victor.~~ CLOSED — §16bc legs HF, HG, HH.** It runs on
real hardware: **`v9k: dos oem=fd ver=622 irq1=09`**, §16av's IRQ1 branch
executing for the first time, with §1b's direct chip-programming fallback
under it. Channel B, for §16az's reason. **Leg HG at 38400 is the fastest
receive this port has ever done — 1,412–1,438 cps over two passes, 0
damaged, 0 timeouts, 0 resends** — 13–15% faster than MS-DOS 3.1 on the
same machine in the same hour. **And §16ao's console item is closed too**:
`screenshots/stephh IMG_2032.png` shows §1g's ANSI arm drawing the
fullscreen display correctly, which §16az and §16ba both failed to capture.
**What came OUT of it is new item 17.** The text below is kept because it
is what the branches were built from.

**Was: The two things
that would have broken it are now handled, from FreeDOS's own sources, and
NEITHER BRANCH HAS EVER EXECUTED.** §16av part 5.

- **The IRQ1 vector.** Three answers on this machine, all in
  `myfreedos/kernel/victor_pic.asm`'s header: boot ROM ICW2 0x20, MS-DOS
  3.1 0x40 (INT 41h), FreeDOS **0x08 (INT 09h)**. ICW2 is write-only, so
  the probe is INT 21h `AH=30h`, whose BH is **0xFD** for FreeDOS
  (`hdr/version.h:40`, `kernel.asm:75`). Only the vector moves — the mask
  bit and the specific EOI encode the IR level, so `ckvisr.asm` is
  untouched. `v9k: dos oem= ver= irq1=` says which branch ran;
  `-dV9K_IRQ1_FORCE=0x09` is the control.
- **The console.** `victor_ansi.asm:154` passes anything that is not
  `ESC [` **straight through to the screen**, so §16ao's VT52 display
  would print a `Y` and two coordinate bytes 55 times a repaint. §1g now
  has an ANSI arm (`ESC[r;cH`, `ESC[2J`, `ESC[K` — exactly what that
  driver documents) chosen by the same probe;
  `-dV9K_CON_FORCE_ANSI` / `-dV9K_CON_FORCE_VT52` override it.

What is left is the run: **boot FreeDOS for Victor and see `irq1=09` in
the exit report and a legible transfer display.** Also unanswered on that
DOS: how much memory it gives (`v9k/probes/vmem.c` asks), and whether
`/dev/seriala`'s IOCTL control block behaves the same.

**~~Report the `ckcmai.c` nesting upstream.~~** Folded into item 8 —
§16ac found the same region also swallowing `dotakeini()` and
`docmdfile()`, and edit 14 fixed it. One report, not two.

**15. ~~`REMOTE DIRECTORY`.~~ CLOSED — §16aw. It was never broken, and two
sessions had been measuring the debug log.**

**Leg RA: the shipping build lists this project's own 157-file root in
31.077 s, `status: SUCCESS`, 0 timeouts, 0 retransmissions, 275 cps** —
all 157 entries and the one subdirectory in order, the summary line, the
terminating Z, the B, and the `finish` after it answered, then `Closing
/dev/seriala...OK` and a clean exit with the counters flushed.
`rxlost=0 rxfull=0 rxpeak=20 of 4096`. The binary was **md5 `5b7eb873…`,
bit for bit the one §16av shipped**, running the command §16av said wedges.

**The wedge was `-d`.** `nxtdir()` (`ckcfns.c`) hands the packetizer **one
character per call** and debugs **four times per character** — three inside
`if (deblog)` and one outside it, which `wcc -pl` shows and the source
hides. Legs RB and RC are the adjacent control and they are **the same
binary** (`CKRDBG.EXE`), differing only in whether `-d` is on the command
line, over the same four-entry listing:

| | RB (no `-d`) | RC (`-d`) | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| elapsed (host clock) | **2.248 s** | **33.787 s** | **15.0×** |
| effective data rate | 131 cps | 8 cps | 16.4× |
| timeouts / resends | 0 / 0 | 1 / 0 | |

§16k measured `-d` at ~25 ms a byte; four calls is ~100 ms a character, and
leg NT produced one every **115 ms**. Two independent routes, one of them
taken six sections ago for an unrelated reason.

**What leg NT actually showed, re-read.** 56 of 157 entries in ~336 s and
no summary, at ~8.7 characters a second. Its data-packet lengths were
**236, 244, 252, 126, 68, 87, 96, 106, 112, 116, 118** — *collapsing*,
because C-Kermit's slow start was knocking the length down against a server
that could not feed it. Leg RA's are **236, 480, 968, 1944, 3896** —
growing, until they reach `DRPSIZ`. And the packet-14 "resend every 10 s"
was the Victor **correctly answering three NAKs the host had queued** while
it waited; three resends, three ACKs, then the log ends because the
operator gave up. Nothing was stuck at any point.

**§16av's `MAXWLD` 256 / `SSPACE` 4096 fix now has runtime evidence at full
scale** — 158 entries expanded and listed — which leg NT could never
produce.

**The guard is `deb=` on the `v9k: isr=` line.** Its first version was
wrong and legs RB/RC caught it: both printed `deb=0`, because `doexit()`
(`ckuusx.c:5478`) zeroes `deblog` and closes the log *before* calling
`exit()`, so an `atexit()` reporter never sees it. It now latches in
`v9k_ser_install()` and ORs the live value in at print time; **legs RD and
RE are the re-run that makes it fire in both states.** The instrument this
item used to ask for — a per-line `debug()` flush — is **withdrawn**: it
would deepen the very cost that caused the problem, and there was never a
wedge for it to capture.

**16. ~~`msleep()` does not sleep.~~ FIXED AND MEASURED — §16av part 1.**
`NAP` in `ckvictor.h` moves `msleep()` onto upstream's own `nap()` arm
(`ckutio.c:12065`) and `ckvictor.c` §1d supplies a calibrated busy loop.
**`v9k: nap per=409 n=1 req=500 ms tot=50 cs` on five MAME legs** — half a
second, one clock quantum, against the 175 µs a scope caught. No upstream
edit. `tcsendbreak()` is fixed by the same change and **is still
unexercised**: nothing has asked this port for a break. The analysis below
is kept because it is why the fix has the shape it has.

---

*The original item:* §16an, found by a scope aimed at something
else: `HANGUP` should hold DTR and RTS down for `HUPTIME` = 500 ms and the
capture shows **175 µs**.

`ckutio.c`'s `msleep()` has arms for `select()`, `nanosleep()` and
`usleep()`; this build has none, so it compiles the fallback —

```c
if (m >= 1000) { sleep(m/1000); m %= 1000; if (m < 10) return(0); }
if (m > 0) while (m > 0) m--;              /* an empty decrement loop */
```

— which for any `m` under 1000 is a side-effect-free loop on a local that
`-os` is entitled to delete. Two shipped things depend on it:

- **`tthang()` cannot hang up a modem.** Latent: no modem has ever been on
  this bench.
- **`tcsendbreak()` does not send a break.** `ckvictor.c` §1b sets WR5 bit
  4, calls `msleep(275)` and clears it — so the break is two IOCTL round
  trips long where POSIX says *at least* a quarter second. **This one is
  the port's own code**, and it has never been exercised.

**The fix is the port's and it runs into hard rule 6.** INT 21h's only clock
is `AH=2Ch`, which advances in **500 ms steps** on this machine (§16n), so
anything shorter needs a busy loop calibrated once against it — 1980s style,
and `ckvictor.c` §1d is where it belongs beside the other Watcom gaps.
Calibrate at startup, not per call.

**Neither is on any critical path**, which is exactly why this sat unnoticed
for the port's whole life. Do it when something needs a break or a hangup —
or when `msleep()` turns up in a third place.

---

---

**17. THE TRANSFER DISPLAY BREAKS A 38400 RECEIVE ON FREEDOS FOR VICTOR.
NEW, §16bc, and the only live defect on the list.**

**Two failures against a control that is clean twice.** Leg HH: the Victor
NAKs a long data packet repeatedly until the host quits — packet 05 in pass
1, 06 in pass 2 — while the **host records 0 damaged packets**, so the
corruption is entirely in the Victor's receiver. Leg HG is the same leg
with `--nodisplay` and is byte-exact at 1,412–1,438 cps both times.

**The instrument names the location, which is why this is not an argument
by elimination.** From `screenshots/stephh IMG_2035.png`:

```
rxlost=38 rxfull=0 rxpeak=1951 of 4096
peaktag=1 fd=1
lost evt=23 max=2 tag=1 fd=1
wcon n=342 max=22 tot=706 cs      elapsed=1999 cs
```

**`tag=1` is `V9K_TAG_WRITE` and `fd=1` is the console.** §16m's foreground
tag and §16q's first-loss latch agree: the foreground was **inside a write
to the screen** both at the first loss and at the peak. **`wcon` prices it:
342 console writes totalling 7.06 s in a 19.99 s run — 35%.** And
`rxpeak=1951` equals the screen's `Packet Length: 1951`, so the ring peaked
at exactly one packet — **the receiver never got ahead, it lost bytes
inside each long packet**, which is why it is CRC errors and not timeouts.
**First time in this tree the foreground tag has named a defect on its
own.**

**Mechanism, available and not proven:** hard rule 6 puts every console
write through INT 21h; §16az established that the myfreedos kernel
busy-waits on TBE and writes a character to the 7201 on **every** INT 21h
call; §16ag established that at 38400 the foreground has no slack per byte.

**Two things the evidence does NOT support, so do not write them down as
if it did.** HG and HH differ in the display **and** the redirect, so what
is measured is *console output*, not specifically §1g's cursor addressing.
And **no MS-DOS 38400 display leg exists**, so FreeDOS-specificity is
untested — §16ba measured the display at ~6 s (~12%) on a 9600 MS-DOS
receive, which was survivable; here it is fatal.

**The cheap next legs, in order:**

1. **One MS-DOS leg at 38400 with the display on.** Settles whether this is
   FreeDOS or is simply 38400. Costs one leg and needs no new binary.
2. **One FreeDOS leg at 38400, display on, WITH the redirect** — that
   separates the display from the redirect, which HH could not.
3. **9600 on FreeDOS with the display on**, for whether it is rate or DOS.

**Do not fix it before measuring which it is.** If it is console cost in
general, the lever is `wcon`: 342 writes for one transfer is a lot, and
§1g repaints far more than it needs to. If it is FreeDOS's INT 21h tracer,
it is not this port's to fix and the answer is documentation —
**`--nodisplay` at 38400 on that DOS.**

## 2. The two builds

`ckvisr.asm` is the default. `XFLAGS=-dV9K_CISR` puts the C handler back in
the vector; it stays compiled in both builds as the specification and the
fallback.

**The exit report says which one ran** — `v9k: isr=asm` or `isr=c`. Two
builds selected by a `-d` flag produce otherwise identical-looking `.OUT`
files, and provenance cost this project time twice before that line existed.

**The same line now says whether the debug log was open** — `v9k: isr=asm
deb=1` (§16aw). `deb=1` means every timing figure in that leg is void:
`-d` costs ~25 ms a byte (§16k) and four times that per character on the
`REMOTE DIRECTORY` path. **Read `deb=` before reading the clock**, the way
§16aq says to read `bulk sel=` before reading the clock. It was the absence
of this field that let three legs be interpreted as a broken feature.

Selecting the assembly handler implies `V9K_LEANLOST`, because it does not
maintain the burst table. Without that, the report would print
`b1 at=0 end=0 n=0` from a table nothing writes.

**If you touch `ckvisr.asm`:**

- It reads no header. `V9K_RXMASK` is a literal `0FFFh`, and `ckvictor.c`
  fails the build if `V9K_RXBUFSIZ` stops being 4096.
- It declares `DGROUP GROUP CONST,CONST2,_DATA,_BSS`. `mov ax,DGROUP`
  assembles to the group *base*; declare a subset and the linker could give
  you `_DATA`'s base while the C half uses the real one, which silently
  corrupts every variable the handler touches. **Verify it after linking**:
  read the immediate out of the executable and compare against the map's
  DGROUP paragraph. §16t has the method.
- The 7201 and the 8259 are both addressed through one `ES` at `E000h` —
  control A `42h`, data A `40h`, channel B `43h`/`41h`, 8259 command `0`.
- **It cannot be exercised at 38400 anywhere but the bench.** Validate what
  can be validated first: a 32 KB receive at 9600 under MAME covers the
  vector, the DGROUP base, the port addressing, the ring arithmetic and
  every counter. That is what §16t did before the drive.

---

## 3. Instruments

- **`v9k:` lines on stdout at exit, every build.** `isr=`, then
  `rxlost/rxfull/rxpeak`, `peaktag/fd/stall256`, `rxbytes/peakat/stallat`,
  `norx/othrx/rr0/oth`, `lost evt/max/tag/fd`, `lostat/lostend`, **`flow`**,
  `wfile`, `wcon`, `txgap`, `elapsed/wire`, `mdm` — plus a `b<N>` row per
  burst in a `-dV9K_CISR` build without `-dV9K_LEANLOST`. **`wire=` is bytes on the
  wire per second**, retransmissions and headers included; it is not
  C-Kermit's file cps, which is what the take-files' `statistics` prints.
  **In `mdm`, only `cts` and `dsr` are measurements** — `dcd` is forced on
  by the carrier clause under `CLOCAL`, and `rts`/`dtr` are read back from
  the last WR5 written rather than from the pins.
- **A byte at 38400 is 260 µs, at 19200 520 µs, at 9600 1,040 µs.** The tree
  said 26 µs in seven places until §16t; if you ever see that figure again
  it is a relic. Both ends are 8N1 — `tcgetattr` returns a *cached* struct
  with `CSTOPB` clear, so `CONFIG.SYS`'s `stop(1.5)` never survives.
- **The clock quantum is 0.5 s and it is the Victor's.** Read `tot=`, never
  `max=`. Three samples measure nothing.
- **`rxpeak` measures the host's retransmission, not the transfer.** §16m
  reached that by instrumenting the peak; §16ag confirmed it by absence —
  leg AM ran with no retransmission and came back at **17 of 4,096** where
  every retransmitting leg in the same session sat at 299. So a `rxpeak`
  comparison between two legs is only meaningful if both retransmitted the
  same number of times.
- **Two legs per arm, and do not trust a single pair's spread.** §16ag's
  control arm put two runs of one binary **321 ms** apart while its other
  two arms held to 1 ms and 5 ms, with no explanation offered or found.
- **Byte offsets map onto the host packet log**, resends included:
  `python3 v9k/tools/mapoffset.py host.pkt --rxbytes <rxbytes> <offset>...` —
  **always pass `--rxbytes`**, which computes and applies the startup
  dead-air shift. §16r nearly published a wrong answer for want of it.
- **`python3 v9k/tools/pktstat.py host.pkt`** decodes a log **in both
  directions** — packets and types, **wire bytes**, longest packet, timeouts,
  retransmissions by either end, **prefix counts and the prefixing policy**.
  It read only the log-writer's own half until 9 August 2026 and reported
  "longest 49, retransmissions 0" for a send log with 3,614-character lines
  and four Victor resends; both halves are fixed. A remote retransmission has
  no marker of its own — it is the same sequence number arriving twice
  running. **`--rxbytes N [--rxfull N]` reconciles against the Victor's ISR
  counter**: `host wire bytes − rxbytes = rxfull + startup offset`, where the
  offset is **−11** clean or **+28** with a startup timeout, and anything
  else means the two ends did not see the same transfer. On §16af leg AJ the
  residual is exactly that leg's published `rxfull` of 741.
  **Reach for it whenever an effect is too small to time**: wire bytes are
  counted and deterministic where the bench's clock is not.
  The `PX_*` tables it names policies from are a **transcription** of
  `setprefix()`, in the sense `v9k/proofs/` uses the word — if upstream
  changes, the naming goes quietly wrong while still printing a name. The
  counts are measurements and stay true either way.
- **`v9k: flow in= out= hi= lo= held= rel= xoff= xon= stuck=`** (§16aj).
  `in`/`out` are 0 none, 1 XON/XOFF, 2 RTS/CTS, and they are read from
  upstream's `flow` and not from the termios bits — see §1 item 11 for why
  that distinction is load-bearing. **On a healthy shipping leg every
  counter is 0 and that IS the result**: the high mark is 3,072 and the
  largest occupancy this port has recorded is 2,581, so the insurance did
  not have to pay out. A leg that means to exercise the mechanism builds
  `-dV9K_RXHIGH=256 -dV9K_RXLOW=64` and expects `held` and `rel` to move
  together and **end equal**; `held > rel` leaves the far end held off.
  `stuck` should never move — it counts writes abandoned after seconds of
  hold-off. **Intercepted XON/XOFF are excluded from `rxbytes` on purpose**,
  because they are not in the host's packet log; `pktstat.py --rxbytes` gave
  the same −11 residual with five of them as without (§16aj leg FH), which
  is the check that says the choice was right.
- **A MAME A/B is only comparable within legs run back to back.** §16ag's
  arms held to 1 ms; §16aj's two groups, same fixture, drifted **12–15 s
  apart** because the host machine got busier — the *host's* timeout count
  went 3 → 5 and the packet shape changed with it. The emulator is not the
  variable. Run the control adjacent to the treatment, always.
- **`v9k/probes/macspeed.c`** sets a non-standard bit rate on a macOS port via
  `IOSSIOSPEED`, which is the only way to reach the x1 rates the Victor can
  actually produce (§11a0). `-h` to hold it; give C-Kermit no `set speed`.
- **`make -C v9k/proofs`** builds *and runs* both standing proofs:
  `vburst.c` replays the ISR burst detector (17 cases) and `vcrc16.c`
  checks edit 17's `chk3()` against upstream's over all 256 table entries
  and 20,500 length-and-fill combinations. Re-run after touching either.
  **A proof that is only compiled has not proved anything**, which is why
  the Makefile runs them.
- **`v9k/probes/vasm.c`** records what Open Watcom will and will not do for an
  ISR: `__interrupt` always saves twelve registers, and `#pragma aux` cannot
  be used for one at all. Compile it and read `wdis` before believing
  otherwise.
- **`v9k: nap per= n= req= tot= cs cc=`** (§16av). `per` is spins per
  centisecond from the one-off calibration; `n`/`req`/`tot` are calls,
  milliseconds asked for and centiseconds observed; `cc` counts Ctrl-C
  interrupts handled. **Every run that opened a line has n>=1**, because
  `exithangup` sends `tthang()` through `msleep(500)`. Read `tot` against
  `req/10` in the aggregate only — one 500 ms nap reads 50 or 100 and
  neither is wrong. `per=0 n=0` means nothing asked for a delay; any other
  zero is a defect.
- **`v9k: dos oem= ver= irq1=`** (§16av). `oem` is BH from INT 21h
  `AH=30h`; **0xfd is FreeDOS and irq1 is then 09**, anything else takes
  the MS-DOS 3.1 layout and 41. The whole "one binary, two DOSes" claim
  turns on this byte, and a wrong branch looks exactly like a chip that
  never interrupts.
- **`deb=` on the `v9k: isr=` line** (§16aw). 1 if the debug log was open,
  **latched at `v9k_ser_install()`** because `doexit()` closes the log
  before `atexit()` runs and the first version therefore always said 0.
  **`deb=1` voids every timing figure in the leg** — `-d` is ~25 ms a byte
  (§16k), and four times that per character on the `REMOTE DIRECTORY`
  path, which is what made a working feature look broken for two sessions.
  Read it before the clock.
- **`v9k: coll=`** (§16av). The file-collision policy actually in force at
  exit. `XYFX_X` = 1 (REPLACE, this port's default), `XYFX_D` = 4
  (refuse), `XYFX_R` = 0 (RENAME, which a `--safe-server` forces and which
  FAT cannot do). It exists because §16ai's trap is invisible otherwise —
  and it caught that exact trap on leg NB.
- **`nospc=` on the `v9k: wfile` line** (§16av). Writes that returned 0
  bytes with no error, i.e. a full disk. Non-zero means the transfer was
  failed deliberately rather than allowed to spin.
- **`python3 v9k/tools/wirenoise.py --listen 8000 --link /tmp/v9000 --flip
  3e-4 --dir to-victor --seed 17`** (§16av) — a drop-in replacement for the
  harness `socat` line that corrupts the wire on purpose. Corruption is
  keyed on byte OFFSET, so two arms of an A/B meet the same noise and a leg
  is reproducible from its seed. It reports bytes relayed and corrupted,
  with offsets that feed `mapoffset.py`. **Read the corrupted count before
  the result**: §16aq's cable-round-mains stimulus produced zero errors and
  that was an instrument failure, not a null.
- **`python3 v9k/tools/mzsize.py ckermitw.exe`** — run this, not `ls -l`. It
  prints **the smallest Victor that can load the build**, which is the
  number to report; `-a 0` gives the requirement alone and `-a <bytes>`
  checks another machine. **Quote the requirement, not the spare** (§16x).
- **`v9k/probes/vmem.c`** asks a running Victor what DOS will give it, INT 21h
  `AH=4Ah` plus `_psp`. Build lines in its header. This is what retired the
  396,224 figure, and it is the way to answer the same question on
  FreeDOS-for-Victor or on real hardware, neither of which has been asked.
- **`CKERMITW -d -h` is the 2.5-minute oracle** for anything decided before
  or during `sysinit()`.
- **Do NOT combine `-dKEEP_DEBUG` with anything about throughput** — ~25 ms
  per received byte (§16k).
- **There is no `-fstack-usage` under Open Watcom.**

---

## 4. Things that are known-incomplete

- **The Victor takes 40–85 s to load the program**, 205 KB shipping and
  435 KB parser, off SASI before `main()` runs. Any leg where the host
  initiates must start the Victor first and *wait*; `MAXTRY` is 10
  (`ckcker.h:472`) and a host that gives up looks exactly like a Victor that
  failed. Host take-files now carry `set retry 30`.
- **`SET FILE COLLISION` is `BACKUP`, and BACKUP cannot work on FAT.**
  Symptom: S, F, A, then **Z with data `D`** and no data packets, a
  ~287-byte packet log, and `No files were transferred (refused:
  destination file already exists)` on the Victor's screen. **This has now
  voided two sittings' worth of legs (§16ak's re-run of DA/DB).** "Fresh
  filename per run" is a rule a person has to remember; the fix that works
  is in the `.BAT` —

  ```
  IF EXIST RCVGB.DAT DEL RCVGB.DAT
  CKFCMID -l /dev/seriala -b 38400 --rtscts -r > STEPGB.OUT
  ```

  **Put that line in every receive `.BAT` from now on**, and still use a
  target name that has never been used, so a re-run cannot silently compare
  itself against an older file.
- ~~**`REMOTE DIRECTORY` wedges on LONG listings only**~~ **RETRACTED —
  §16aw.** It does not wedge on any listing. Leg RA lists a 157-file root
  in **31.077 s, 0 timeouts, 0 retransmissions**, summary and terminating
  Z included, and answers the FINISH. Every leg that saw a "wedge" ran
  `-d`, and `nxtdir()` debugs four times per output character — 15× on the
  clock, measured on one binary with and without the flag (legs RB/RC).
  The `MAXWLD` 64 / `SSPACE` 2048 ceiling was real and is fixed (256 /
  4096), now confirmed at full scale. Item 15.
- **Most of the default capability set is untested** (§16i). `BYE` never sent.
- **Wildcards are case-sensitive.** `-s *.TXT`.
- **The FreeDOS console arm has never run** (§16av part 5), and neither has
  the FreeDOS IRQ1 branch. Both are written from `myfreedos`'s own sources.
- **`v9k/tools/wirenoise.py` has never corrupted a real wire** (§16av part
  7). It is self-tested on the host — relay, direction, `--after`,
  reproducibility, reported offsets matching observed corruptions — and the
  leg it exists for (edit 18's bulk arm against `--nobulk` over a noisy
  line) is unrun. Its first mixer had a period of 100 and was caught by
  looking at the offsets, which is the check to repeat if it is changed.
- ~~**`-s <name>` for files of 32,768 bytes or more.**~~ **CLOSED** — §16ah
  leg BS sent exactly 32,768 bytes by name, byte-exact, no error line.
  Upstream edit 16 now has runtime evidence and **no shipped edit in this
  port lacks it.**
- ~~**`pktstat.py` misreads a Victor-send log.**~~ **FIXED 9 August 2026.**
  It reads both directions, counts wire bytes and prefixes, names the
  prefixing policy, and reconciles against `rxbytes`. Checked against all 47
  logs in the tree with no unparsable lines.
- ~~**No interrupt-level flow control**, `tcflow()` is a stub, and the ring
  has no water marks.~~ **BUILT — §16aj**, both mechanisms, both directions,
  `tcflow()` implemented, marks at 3/4 and 1/4. **It ships OFF** and the
  reason is item 11: nothing needs it at a window of one, and selecting
  RTS/CTS gates the transmitter on a CTS nothing has measured in that
  direction. So the 105-byte margin between `DRPSIZ = 4000` and the 4,096
  ring is still what holds today — but it is now an accident with a
  fallback, which is what made it a precondition for items 10 and 12.
- **No stack switch in the handler** — deliberate, and the assembly one is a
  10-byte frame.
- **`msleep()` is a no-op below one second** (§16an), so `tthang()` cannot
  hang up a modem and **`tcsendbreak()` does not send a break** — the latter
  is `ckvictor.c` §1b's own code. Measured on a scope: a `HANGUP` that
  should hold the lines down for `HUPTIME` = 500 ms holds them for 175 µs.
  §1 item 16.
- **Nothing has ever shown the host's CTS moving at the moment the Victor's
  RTS does** (§16an). The cable is strongly indicated to carry it — `cts`
  lags `dsr`/`dcd` by 25 ms on power-down, so it is a separate signal — but
  the watcher runs were taken during power-up, not during a transfer. **One
  two-probe capture, both ends of the CTS conductor during a `STEPGB` run,
  closes it.**
- ~~**Out of disk space makes the Victor HANG, not fail.**~~ **DIAGNOSED
  AND FIXED — §16av part 3**, and the mechanism is smaller and worse than
  the note said. It is not a missing timeout: `zoutdump()`
  (`ckufio.c:2172`) tests `write() > -1`, and INT 21h `AH=40h` on a full
  volume returns **0 with CF clear**, which is the success branch — so the
  loop subtracts nothing, advances nothing, and spins for ever. No
  `alarm()` can reach a receiver that never asks to read. One compare in
  `v9k_write()` turns it into `ENOSPC`. Leg NF: 8.0 KB free, 32 KB sent,
  host gets `FAILURE / Error writing data` in 58 s. **The control
  (`-dV9K_NOSPC_OFF`) has not been run.** And note what the leg taught
  about itself: **`STEPNF.OUT` came back 0 bytes**, because the redirect
  carrying every `v9k:` counter was on the disk under test. Write an
  out-of-disk leg's output to `D:\`, which is 9.7 MB and empty.
- ~~**The IRQ1 vector is hard-coded to 41h.**~~ **Chosen at run time from
  INT 21h `AH=30h` — §16av part 5.** 41h for MS-DOS 3.1, 09h for FreeDOS
  (OEM 0xFD). Reported as `v9k: dos oem= ver= irq1=`. **The FreeDOS branch
  has never executed.**
- ~~**Ctrl-Break with the line open** is not covered by `atexit()`.~~
  **Fixed, unexercised — §16av part 4.** The exposure was two keystrokes,
  not one: Watcom's `raise()` demotes SIGINT to `SIG_DFL` and returns INT
  23h to DOS *before* calling the handler, and upstream's `cctrap` sets a
  `cc_int` that **nothing in the tree reads** — so the first ^C did
  nothing observable and spent the single shot, and the second terminated
  the program with IRQ1 still hooked. A self-re-arming handler installed
  from `v9k_ser_install()` closes it. **`cc=0` on every leg: nothing has
  pressed Ctrl-C on a Victor.** MAME's keyboard is not the instrument;
  the bench is.
- **WR2 is left as the OEM driver set it** (`10h` vs 3.13's `14h`). Never
  tested, and no longer suspected of anything — it was on the list only
  while 38400 was unexplained.
- **The carrier clause** in `ttgmdm()` forces carrier present under `CLOCAL`.
- **The assembly ISR's overrun branch has never executed.** 38400 is clean
  now, so nothing reaches it. It is transcribed from the C and reviewed in
  `wdis`, and that is all the evidence there is.
- **The Victor sent a NAK, once, and it is not explained.** §16v leg CB,
  19200, `s16uCB.pkt:20` — the first in this project's history, against
  §16l's "only ACKs, never a NAK". `rxlost = 0`, so **not** a chip overrun;
  checksum failure versus our own receive timer is not separable from that
  log. Leg CA at the higher rate was perfectly clean, so it is not a rate
  effect. One occurrence, no instrument pointed at it.
- **The foreground time is one bucket — 17.7 s at leg AG.** Measured by
  subtraction — elapsed minus line minus `wfile` minus `txgap` — so it is
  a total, not a decomposition, and nothing yet separates per-byte decode
  from per-packet fixed cost. §1 item 9.
- **The bench does not repeat to better than ~1.3 s on protocol-identical
  legs**, and the cause is unknown. That, not the Victor's 50 cs clock, is
  what bounds every per-item cost in this port — §16ah retired §16af's "one
  clock quantum" on exactly this. §1 item 5b.
- ~~**The prefixing fix is unverified on the wire.**~~ **VERIFIED — §16ai
  legs CC/CD.** `PX_CAU exactly (32 values)`, 4,512 prefixes, 37,557 wire
  bytes, byte-exact, against the control's `PX_ALL exactly (66)`, 8,869 and
  41,945. −10.5% traffic.
- **The parser build has two interactive prompts on the receive path that
  the shipping build cannot have**, and a redirect makes them fatal.
  `set receive confirm off` and `set exit warning off` are in `RXEA.KSC`;
  any *new* Victor-side take-file for a `KEEP_ICP` build needs them too.
  This is a property of the build, not a bug — see "The harness had two
  defects" above for why the shipping build is exempt.
- ~~**The RTS/CTS output direction is unmeasured.**~~ **CLOSED on the port's
  side by §16an**: the pin moves, eight times mid-transfer, on a scope. What
  is open is the *host's* side — nothing has been shown to stop for it,
  because the bench Mac's C-Kermit cannot be made to watch CTS.
- **`stall256 = 2,399` on leg DB against 47 on its control, unexplained**
  (§16ak). Occupancy crossed the 256 mark upward fifty times more often on
  the RTS/CTS leg, which needs the sender to have paused — but 15
  assert/release cycles cannot produce 2,399 crossings. It is the only
  positive hint that the host obeys our RTS and it is not proof.
- **Leg DC lost 19 bytes and nothing else in the sitting lost any** (§16ak).
  XON/XOFF at the same water marks as RTS/CTS, 11 bursts, first non-zero
  `rxlost` on this bench since §16t. Cause not established.
- **Nothing counts a FAILED XOFF attempt.** The single-shot assert re-reads
  RR0 on every byte until the transmitter is free. That retry is invisible
  and it is the leading suspect for DC.
- **`pktstat.py`'s reconciliation has no term for BELL substitution.** Leg
  DC's residual is −15 where the formula wants −11, and the difference is
  the 19 BELLs the ISR put in the stream. It needs `--rxlost`.
- **Whether §1f costs 11% of a 38400 receive is open** (§16ak). Three clean
  legs at 31.1–31.5 s against §16ah leg BC's 28.057 s on the identical
  37,557 wire bytes — but cross-sitting. `CKPRE.EXE` is on the image and one
  adjacent pair settles it.
- **Nothing has seen a far end obey our XOFF, and now on hardware too.**
  §16ak leg DX armed the interception path on a real cable and the host
  never sent one — `xoff = 0`. A null, not a failure: the leg still ran
  byte-exact at 1,475 cps.
- **`held = rel` on every leg that asserted** (§16ak), which is the property
  to check; `held > rel` would mean the far end was left held off.
- **The flow-control assert has never run on the ring-full path.**
  `v9k_ringfull` re-enters the water-mark check with occupancy forced to the
  mask; nothing has executed it, the same standing caveat as the assembly
  handler's overrun branch.
- **Four other XI initializers have never been checked for the same
  problem.** `_fmode`, the server capability gate and `zobufsize` all set
  upstream state before `main()`, and `initproto()` is not the only thing
  that re-initialises. `_fmode` and `zobufsize` are witnessed indirectly (a
  binary transfer is byte-exact; `wfile` fell to 4 writes), and the server
  gate was witnessed through `uname()` in §16i — **but none was checked
  against a later upstream write of the same variable.** Leg CS exercises the
  server gate on hardware by a different route. §16aj's flow-control
  initializer is the fourth, and it is the one that was *designed* around
  the trap: it writes nothing upstream owns, and `v9k_ser_install()` puts
  the value into `cxflow[CXT_DIRECT]` one statement before `setflow()`
  reads it.
- **The shipping binary is 44 bytes different from the one the bench ran.**
  §16ah legs BC/BD ran 205,256, which carried the `errno` initializer
  compiled-but-unreachable; removing it took the build to **205,212**. The
  removed code never executed, and §16w's size sensitivity makes the delta
  non-zero in principle. Any future leg reporting `rxlost=0 rxfull=0` and a
  byte-exact md5 sweeps it up; nothing needs to be done for its own sake.
- **`NOCKXXCHAR`'s 2.1% is not attributed.** The change removes two
  instructions per byte, 512 bytes of DGROUP and 756 of code all at once,
  and §16w established this machine is sensitive to the last of those. It
  ships because no reading makes it a loss, not because the mechanism is
  known.
- **`v9k/proofs/` carries transcriptions, not references.** `vcrc16.c` has
  its own copy of upstream's `chk3()` and of `crcta[]`/`crctb[]`;
  `vburst.c` has its own copy of the ISR counter update. They prove
  agreement with *what was transcribed*. If upstream's `chk3()` changes or
  the ISR counters are reworked, both keep passing and mean less than they
  say. `ckvictor.c` has a build-time check for exactly this drift on the
  ring size; there is no equivalent for a host program that never sees the
  target's headers.
- **`wire=` is a receive-leg figure.** It divides `rxbytes`, so on a send
  leg it reports the ACK stream over the whole elapsed time. No send leg has
  ever been timed.
- **cps above 38400 is unmeasured and probably uninteresting** — and it is
  moot anyway, since §11a0 established 39,062.50 bps as a *hardware*
  ceiling. §16af's no-line ceiling of ~1,797 cps caps the payoff at ~54%
  even if the wire were free.

---

## 5. Still open, from before

**The parser build is no longer "still open" — §16y built it.** See §1
**item 7** for what is left of it — the hardware leg, whose one real unknown
is that **no transfer has ever been run with the parser build** — and §16y
for the sizes. (This used to point at §1 item 1, which now means the closed
calibration item.)

**Why `binmode.obj`'s near init record does not work here** (§16h).

---

## 6. The harness

**Bench.** Pico SASI serving `victor_kermit.img`; channel A; 1 m USB-C to
RS-232. Power-cycle the Victor *and* the Pico between runs. Fresh target
filename every run. Do not write to the image while the machine is running.

**`~/.kermrc` already sets up the bench, so a take-file only needs what
differs.** It carries `set line /dev/tty.usbserial-BG022B8M`, `set speed`,
`set parity none`, `set carrier-watch off` and `set flow none`. A take-file
therefore needs the speed for the leg, the log name, the transfer and
`statistics`:

```
set speed 38400
set receive timeout 20
log packets s16uCA.pkt
send rcvca.dat
statistics
```

**Redirect to keep the host's cps, and treat it as mandatory rather than
optional:** `kermit -C "take s16uCA.ksc, exit" > s16uCA.host`. It was
skipped twice — §16ae's seven legs and §16af's three — which cost a whole
sitting to repair; **§16ah captured it on all seven legs and found that the
Victor's 50 cs quantum was never the binding limit anyway, the bench's own
~1.3 s spread is** (§1 item 5b). Capture it regardless: it is what
distinguishes "the difference is below the noise" from "we cannot see the
difference". **Three files per leg: `.host`, `.pkt`, and the Victor's
`.OUT`.** A leg missing the `.host` cannot resolve any difference
smaller than the Victor's 50 cs quantum, which is most of them. `s16uCA.ksc` and `s16uCB.ksc` in the tree are the files that
ran §16v; they additionally repeat `set line` and `set parity none`, which
is harmless and was not necessary. **An earlier version of this section
claimed those lines were required and built a rule on it. They were not,
and there is no rule** — see the retraction at the end of §16v, which is
about how the error was made rather than about take-files.

**MAME.** Still the right place for anything that would cost a drive to get
wrong, and it validated `ckvisr.asm` before the bench.

- `socat` first (single-use `-bitb`), then MAME, then wait ~110 s before
  starting the host `kermit`. `-seconds_to_run 300` for a 32 KB receive.
- **9600 is the emulator's ceiling**, not a setting.
- **Use `-r`, not `-x`**, when the point is a receive measurement.
- **One `kermit` attempt per MAME run, unique log names** — `log packets`
  truncates.
- The host take-file must `set line /tmp/v9000` explicitly, because
  `~/.kermrc` points at the bench adapter.
- `.BAT` files need CRLF — **now guaranteed**: `.gitattributes` marks
  `*.BAT` as `text eol=crlf` and the harness `.BAT`s are tracked, so a
  checkout produces CRLF whatever wrote the file, and a leg is reproduced
  rather than regenerated. That was the actual cause of the landmine going
  off twice. `-autoboot_command` takes the literal `\n`;
  **digits come through shifted under MAME** so use digit-free `.BAT` names
  (`STEPASM`, not `STEP0`); MS-DOS 3.1 cannot redirect handle 2; the disk
  boots as `A:`; use `vtg_image_util`, never mtools.
- Backups: `victor_kermit.img.bak-20260807-preregress` is the last one,
  taken before the image was cleared of §16w–§16y experiment files.
- **On the image now.** Names are deliberately distinct because the exit
  report cannot tell two builds apart — keep the `.OUT` names apart too.
  - `CKERMITW.EXE` — the current shipping build, **205,228, needs 219,452
    (214K), smallest Victor 384K, md5 `537486a8…`** — re-staged 9 August
    with the prefixing fix. **This name always means "current shipping"** —
    a stale binary under it is the trap §16ah's staging notes are about.
    (It was 205,212 / md5 `3c31dbf4…` before the fix; the load requirement
    did not move, because the 16 extra bytes land inside a paragraph DOS was
    already rounding up.)
  - **`CKWINB.EXE` — 226,936, md5 `7ce2cac8…`, current HEAD**, the build
    that carries `--window=N` and the `dec` counter. Round-trip verified
    off the image. §16ar's legs WC/WD/WE ran it, and **`HW_TEST_16ar.md`'s
    five bench legs are staged against it** (`STEPXA/XB/XD/XE/XF.BAT`, all
    CRLF-verified after landing, target names `RCVX*.DAT` never used).
    Host side `s16asX*.ksc` and `rcvx*.dat` in the tree.
    `STEPWC/WD/WE.BAT` are §16ar's MAME legs and also name this binary.
    **`CKWIN.EXE` and `STEPWA/WB.BAT` were deleted** — the pre-`dec`-fix
    build and the two legs that ran it, superseded by WD/WE; a `.BAT` whose
    binary is gone is a leg that fails for a reason that has nothing to do
    with the port.
  - `CKPXALL.EXE` — **205,228, md5 `ddb93453…`, `-dV9K_PREFIXING=PX_ALL`.**
    The control for leg CC: same tree, same commit, same size, differing
    only in the immediate constant the prefixing initializer stores, so
    §16w's code-size sensitivity has nothing to act on.
  - `CKAP.EXE` — 205,256, md5 `433148fa…`. **The binary §16ah legs
    BA/BB/BS/BC/BD actually ran**, and §16ag legs AP/AQ before them. It
    differs from what now ships by the 44 bytes of removed `errno` code.
  - `CKFERR.EXE` — 204,888, md5 `415cf233…`, `-dV9K_FAST_ERRNO`. Legs BE/BF,
    and §16ag legs AL/AN. **The change it carries is no longer in the
    tree** (§16ah); the binary is kept because it is a measured artefact.
  - `CKAK.EXE` — §16af's edit-17 build, 205,968, md5 `8d40f7f6…`, which
    §16ag legs AK/AR/AM ran.
  - `STEPBA/BB/BS/BC/BD/BE/BF.BAT` — the seven bench legs of
    `HW_TEST_16ag.md`, staged and verified CRLF *after* landing on the
    image. Host side: `s16ahB*.ksc` and `rcvb*.dat` in the tree.
  - `CKBASE.EXE` — the sixteen-edit baseline, 205,552, staged as §16af's
    control so leg AJ is a *binary* difference and not a rebuild. Keep it:
    any future "did this change help" leg wants the same shape.
  - `STEPAG.BAT` / `STEPAH.BAT` / `STEPAJ.BAT` — §16af's three legs, and
    `STEPAF.BAT` for the MAME leg. All four are tracked in git now, so
    re-stage them from a checkout rather than regenerating.
  - **§16aj's flow-control legs.** `CKFCA.EXE` — the shipping build,
    206,758, md5 `c5652a5b…`, same tree as `CKERMITW.EXE`. `CKFCLO.EXE` —
    **the same 206,758 bytes** with `-dV9K_RXHIGH=256 -dV9K_RXLOW=64`,
    differing in two immediate constants, so `--xonxoff` against
    `--noflow` on it is one binary and one switch with no code-size
    difference for §16w to bite on. `CKFCD.EXE` — 288,106, `KEEP_DEBUG`,
    for the `-d -h` switch witness. `CKPRE.EXE` — 205,228, md5
    `537486a8…`, **HEAD before §1f rebuilt**, which is how leg FZ is a
    binary difference and not a rebuild. `STEPFA/FB/FC/FD/FE/FG/FH/FJ/FZ`
    and `RCVF*.DAT`; host side `s16ajF*.ksc` and `rcvf*.dat` in the tree.
  - `CKICP.EXE` / `CKICPD.EXE` — the parser build, and the same with
    `KEEP_DEBUG`. **Rebuilt and re-staged 9 August**, 435,154 md5
    `f5456cae…` and 546,422 md5 `6d991fc7…`. The 8 August copies predated
    upstream edits 16 and 17 and are gone; without edit 17 a 38400 transfer
    against them reproduces §16af's ring defect and reads as "the parser
    build breaks transfers".
  - `STEPCC/CD/CE/CH/CS.BAT` — the five legs of `HW_TEST_16ai.md`, staged
    and verified CRLF **after** landing on the image. Host side:
    `s16aiC*.ksc` and `rcvce/rcvch/rcvcs.dat` in the tree. `RXEA.KSC`,
    `PTEST.KSC`, `SPDTEST.KSC`, `STEPSPD.BAT` and `TRANS.DAT` are reused
    unchanged from §16y/§16z.
  - **The x1 sweep binaries and their one-line `.BAT`s:**

    | BAT | binary | mode | count | bps |
    |---|---|---|---:|---:|
    | `S96X16` | `CKERMITW -b 9600` | x16 | 8 | 9,766 |
    | `S96X1` | `CKX9600.EXE` | x1 | 130 | 9,615 |
    | **`S96X1S`** | **`CKX96S.EXE`** | **x1 + `DRPSIZ=90`** | **130** | **9,615** |
    | `S384X1` | `CKX384.EXE` | x1 | 33 | 37,879 |
    | `S576` | `CKERMITW -b 57600` | x1 | 22 | 56,818 |
    | `S768` | `CKERMITW -b 76800` | x1 | 16 | 78,125 |
    | `S1152` | `CKERMITW -b 115200` | x1 | 11 | 113,636 |

    `S96X1S` is the unrun one and it belongs to §1 item 6, which is closed. The `CKX*` builds carry
    `-dV9K_CLKBITS`/`-dV9K_COUNT` and therefore **ignore `-b` entirely** —
    one build, one point, no ambiguity about what was on the wire.
  - `SPDTEST.KSC` + `STEPSPD.BAT` (parser regression), `PTEST.KSC`,
    `TRANS.DAT` (32,768 bytes, md5 `d94d2beda069ef0ef340977e7fd6995d`).
  - Older `STEP*`/`RCV*` from §16t and §16v are still there. Delete before
    reusing a name — `REN DEBUG.LOG X.LOG` fails silently if `X.LOG`
    exists, leaving a stale log beside a fresh `.OUT`.

**Expected bit periods on TD, for the analyzer** — the right-hand column is
what you would see if the OEM driver's IOCTL ignored CR4's clock bits the
way it ignores CR1. It does not; this is measured. Kept as the check:

| BAT | expected | if CR4 were ignored |
|---|---:|---:|
| S96X16 | 102.4 µs | 102.4 µs |
| S96X1 / S96X1S | 104.0 µs | 1664.0 µs |
| S384X1 | 26.4 µs | 422.4 µs |
| S576 | 17.6 µs | 281.6 µs |
| S768 | 12.8 µs | 204.8 µs |
| S1152 | 8.8 µs | 140.8 µs |

### Testing the parser at the bench — this is what §16y was for

**The bench is the only place this can be tested, and the reason is the
keyboard.** MAME mangles typed input (§16a: digits arrive shifted, and
`CKERMITW -r` once arrived as `CKERIT_R`), which is why every run in this
project has come from a `.BAT`. An interactive prompt needs a real keyboard,
and the Victor has one.

**Rebuild and re-stage `CKICP.EXE`/`CKICPD.EXE` before any of this** — the
staged copies are from 8 August and predate edits 16 and 17, and step 3
below is a 38400 transfer that would reproduce §16af's ring defect against
them. §1 item 7.0 has the commands.

Type `CKICP` and expect `C-Kermit>`. In rough order:

1. **`show versions`** — proves the parser reads a line, looks up a keyword
   and runs a command. **Console input has never been exercised in this
   port**: every `NOICP` build only ever wrote to the console, so
   `coninc()`/`congks()` through INT 21h are new ground. If anything is
   going to fail, it is more likely this than the parser.
2. **`take ptest.ksc`** — and this one is a **diagnostic, not just a
   feature**. Interactive `TAKE` goes through `cmifip()` (`ckuusr.c` around
   10590), a *different* path from the command-line `argv[1]` route
   (`prescan()` → `findinpath()`, `ckuus4.c:1741`) that §16ac's edit 14
   repaired. So:
   - it works → any residue is isolated to `findinpath()`/`prescan()`;
   - it fails the same way → the problem is lower down, in `zopeni()` or
     `access()` on a FAT root, and §1d is where to look.
   Try `CKICP PTEST.KSC` from the DOS prompt too, as the control that
   reproduces the known failure.
3. **`take rxea.ksc`**, with the host running
   `kermit -C "take s16zREA.ksc, exit" > s16zREA.host` — a full 32 KB
   receive at 38400 driven by the Victor from a file. **No transfer has ever
   been run with the parser build.**
4. **The same by hand** — `set line /dev/seriala`, `set speed 38400`,
   `receive` — if the take-file route fails, since it isolates the parser
   from the file lookup.

Worth knowing before reading results: the parser build **cannot** do `-C`,
variables, macros or `INPUT` (that is `NOSPL`, and `KEEP_SPL` costs another
209 KB), and `SET FILE COLLISION` is still `BACKUP`, which cannot work on
FAT — **use a fresh target name every run.**

## 7. Rebuilding

```sh
container exec -i ia16-ubuntu-2 bash -c \
  "cd /mnt/projects/ckermit && make -f victorow.mak"        # ckermitw.exe
container exec -i ia16-ubuntu-2 bash -c \
  "cd /mnt/projects/ckermit && make -f victorow.mak sizes"  # DGROUP report
python3 v9k/tools/mzsize.py ckermitw.exe                       # will it LOAD
make -C v9k/proofs                                          # ALL standing proofs
```

Rule 4 still applies: the heap is **outside** DGROUP, the ring is not, and
`V9K_OBUFSIZE` is heap.
